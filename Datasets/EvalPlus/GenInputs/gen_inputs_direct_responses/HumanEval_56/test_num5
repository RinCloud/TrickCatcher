**Test Input Reasoning:**

- The input contains only one opening bracket.
- This is the minimum possible input size.
- This test case is interesting because there is no corresponding closing bracket for the opening bracket.
- The function should return False in this case.

I chose this test case to test the function's handling of the minimum input size.
