```python
from random import randint

def sample_one():
    lst_length = randint(0, 15) # setting a reasonable max length for the list to prevent it being too large
    lst = [randint(-50, 50) for _ in range(lst_length)] # generating random integers between -50 and 50
    generated_input = [lst]
    return generated_input
```
