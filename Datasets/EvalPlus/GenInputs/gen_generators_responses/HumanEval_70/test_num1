```python
from random import randint

def sample_one():
    length_of_lst = randint(0, 10)  # length of the list can be between 0 and 10
    lst = [randint(-100, 100) for _ in range(length_of_lst)]  # generating random integers between -100 and 100
    generated_input = [lst]
    return generated_input
