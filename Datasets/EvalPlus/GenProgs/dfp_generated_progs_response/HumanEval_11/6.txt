def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    Returns the result of performing binary XOR on two binary strings.

    Parameters:
    a (str): The first binary string consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    b (str): The second binary string consisting only of 1s and 0s.

    Returns:
    str: The result of the XOR operation as a binary string.

    Example:
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
