def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """
    You are given two positive integers n and m, 
    and your task is to compute the average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The starting integer
    m (int): The ending integer

    Returns:
    str: The rounded average in binary form

    Examples:
    >>> rounded_avg(1, 5)
    '0b11'
    >>> rounded_avg(7, 5)
    -1
    >>> rounded_avg(10, 20)
    '0b1111'
    >>> rounded_avg(20, 33)
    '0b11010'
