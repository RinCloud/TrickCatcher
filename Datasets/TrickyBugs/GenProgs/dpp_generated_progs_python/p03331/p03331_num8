# Solution

To find the minimum possible value of the sum of the digits of A plus the sum of the digits of B, we can iterate over all possible values of A and calculate the sum of the digits for each value. Then, we can calculate the sum of the digits for B as N - A. Finally, we add the sums of the digits for A and B to get the desired result.

Here is the Python program that solves the problem:

```python
# Read N from input
N = int(input())

# Function to calculate the sum of the digits for a number
def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

# Initial values for the minimum sum of digits and A
min_sum = float('inf')
A = 1

# Iterate over all possible values of A
while A <= N // 2:
    B = N - A
    sum_A = sum_of_digits(A)
    sum_B = sum_of_digits(B)
    min_sum = min(min_sum, sum_A + sum_B)
    A += 1

# Print the minimum possible value
print(min_sum)
```

This program first reads the input value of N. It then defines the `sum_of_digits` function which calculates the sum of the digits for a given number.

The program then initializes the minimum sum of digits (`min_sum`) to a very large value (`float('inf')`) and sets the initial value of A to 1.

The program then enters a loop that iterates over all possible values of A, from 1 to N // 2. For each value of A, it calculates the value of B by subtracting A from N, and then calculates the sum of the digits for both A and B. It updates the minimum sum of digits (`min_sum`) if the current sum is smaller.

Finally, the program prints the minimum possible value of the sum of digits.

This program solves the problem with a time complexity of O(N), where N is the input value.
