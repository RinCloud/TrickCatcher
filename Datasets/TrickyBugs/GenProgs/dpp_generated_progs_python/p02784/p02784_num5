# Approach
To check if Raccoon can win without using the same move twice or more, we need to find the minimum health that can be achieved by using the special moves.

Let's initialize the minimum health as infinity. Then, for each special move, we check if using that move will decrease the minimum health. If it does, we update the minimum health.

Finally, if the minimum health is less than or equal to 0, we print "Yes", otherwise we print "No".

# Complexity Analysis
The time complexity for this approach is O(N), where N is the number of special moves.

Let's write the code now.
