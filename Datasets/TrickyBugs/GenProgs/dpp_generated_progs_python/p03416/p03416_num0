# Solution

A simple solution for this problem would be to iterate over the integers from A to B, convert each integer to a string, and check if the string is a palindrome. If it is, increment a counter variable. Finally, print the value of the counter.

```python
def is_palindrome(n):
    # Convert the integer to a string
    n_str = str(n)
    
    # Check if the string is a palindrome
    return n_str == n_str[::-1]

# Read the inputs
A, B = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize the counter variable
count = 0

# Iterate over the integers from A to B
for i in range(A, B+1):
    # Check if the integer is a palindrome
    if is_palindrome(i):
        # Increment the counter variable
        count += 1

# Print the number of palindromic numbers
print(count)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(N*M), where N is the number of integers between A and B, and M is the average number of digits in the integers. The worst-case scenario is when all integers between A and B are palindromes, in which case the time complexity becomes O(N*M^2).

However, there is an optimized solution that can solve this problem in O(1) time complexity using a mathematical approach. Let's implement this optimized solution.

```python
# Read the inputs
A, B = map(int, input().split())

# Function to count the number of palindromic numbers in a given range
def count_palindromic_numbers(A, B):
    # A palindromic number has the form ABCBA, where A, B, and C are digits.
    # We can calculate the number of palindromic numbers easily based on the values of A and B.
    # If A <= B, then the number of palindromic numbers is (B // 100 - A // 100 + 1)
    # If A > B, then there are no palindromic numbers
    
    if A > B:
        return 0
    
    return (B // 100 - A // 100 + 1)

# Calculate the number of palindromic numbers
count = count_palindromic_numbers(A, B)

# Print the result
print(count)
```

This optimized solution has a time complexity of O(1) as it calculates the number of palindromic numbers directly based on the given range.
