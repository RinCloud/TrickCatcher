# Solution

To find the maximum total number of ingredients, we need to use the two shortest skewers to form each serving. So, we need to sort the skewers in ascending order of their length and sum the lengths of the first N pairs.

Here's the Python program that achieves this:

```python
# Read the value of N from standard input
N = int(input())

# Read the lengths of the skewers from standard input and store them in a list
skewers = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Sort the skewers in ascending order
skewers.sort()

# Sum the lengths of the first N pairs of skewers
total_ingredients = sum(skewers[:2 * N:2])

# Print the maximum total number of ingredients
print(total_ingredients)
```
