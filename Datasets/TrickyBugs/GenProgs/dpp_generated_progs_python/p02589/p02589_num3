# Plan:

1. Take input `N` which represents the number of strings.
2. Take input `N` strings and store them in a list.
3. Initialize a variable `count` as 0 to keep track of the number of pairs.
4. Iterate over each string in the list.
   - For each string, compare it with every other string in the list.
   - If the first two characters of one string match the first two characters of another string, increment the `count` by 1.
5. Print the value of `count`.

```python
N = int(input())
strings = []
for _ in range(N):
    strings.append(input())

count = 0
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(i + 1, N):
        if strings[i][:2] == strings[j][:2] or strings[i][:2] == strings[j][1:]:
            count += 1
        if strings[i][1:] == strings[j][:2] or strings[i][1:] == strings[j][1:]:
            count += 1

print(count)
```
