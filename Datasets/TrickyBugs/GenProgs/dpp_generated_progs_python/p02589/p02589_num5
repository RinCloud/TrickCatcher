# Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, we can count the number of strings that have the same suffix (last two characters) and the same length. 

We will use a dictionary `suffix_counts` to keep track of the count for each suffix. For each string `s`:
1. If the length of `s` is less than 2, we skip it.
2. Calculate the suffix of `s`
3. Increment the count for that suffix in `suffix_counts`

Finally, we iterate over the values in `suffix_counts` and calculate the number of unordered pairs that can be obtained by considering the count for each suffix. 

Here is the complete program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Read input
n = int(input())
strings = [input() for _ in range(n)]

# Count the number of strings that have the same suffix and length
suffix_counts = defaultdict(int)
for s in strings:
    if len(s) >= 2:
        suffix = s[-2:]
        suffix_counts[suffix] += 1

# Calculate the number of unordered pairs
pairs = 0
for count in suffix_counts.values():
    pairs += count * (count - 1) // 2

# Print the result
print(pairs)
```
