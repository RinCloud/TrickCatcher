# Solution

A naive approach would be to iterate through all possible prices before tax starting from 1 and calculate the consumption tax for each price. If the calculated consumption tax matches A or B, we print that price and exit the loop. If no price satisfies the condition, we print -1.

Here is the Python program that implements this approach:

```python
A, B = map(int, input().split())

price = -1
for p in range(1, 10001): # Assuming the maximum price before tax is 10000 yen
    tax8 = p * 8 // 100
    tax10 = p * 10 // 100
    
    if tax8 == A and tax10 == B:
        price = p
        break

print(price)
```

This program takes input from the user in the specified format, splits the input into A and B variables, and then iterates through all possible prices from 1 to 10000. For each price, it calculates the consumption tax at 8 percent (rounded down) and at 10 percent (rounded down). If both calculated taxes match A and B respectively, it sets the current price as the desired price and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints the desired price.

Note: We assume the maximum price before tax is 10000 yen, as mentioned in the problem statement.
