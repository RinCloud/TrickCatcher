# Solution

To find the number of ways to paint the tower, we can iterate through all possible combinations of painting layers and count the number of ways that result in a beauty score of K.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define a 2D array DP of size (N+1) x (K+1), where DP[i][j] represents the number of ways to paint the first i layers of the tower to achieve a beauty score of j.

The base case is DP[0][0] = 1, since there is only one way to achieve a beauty score of 0 with no painted layers.

For each layer i from 1 to N, we can consider three cases:

1. Paint the layer red (score = A): In this case, we need to find the number of ways to paint the remaining (i-1) layers to achieve a beauty score of (j-A). This can be calculated as DP[i-1][j-A].

2. Paint the layer green (score = A+B): In this case, we need to find the number of ways to paint the remaining (i-1) layers to achieve a beauty score of (j-A-B). This can be calculated as DP[i-1][j-A-B].

3. Paint the layer blue (score = B): In this case, we need to find the number of ways to paint the remaining (i-1) layers to achieve a beauty score of (j-B). This can be calculated as DP[i-1][j-B].

The total number of ways to paint the first i layers to achieve a beauty score of j is the sum of the above three cases: DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j-A] + DP[i-1][j-A-B] + DP[i-1][j-B].

Finally, the answer will be DP[N][K] modulo 998244353.

Let's implement this solution in the following code:
