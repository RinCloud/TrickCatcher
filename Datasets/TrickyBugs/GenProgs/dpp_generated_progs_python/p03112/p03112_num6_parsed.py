# Approach:
1. Start by converting the input into a list of shrines and temples' positions.
2. For each query, iterate over the list of shrines and find the closest shrine to the current position.
3. Similarly, iterate over the list of temples and find the closest temple to the current position.
4. Calculate the distances from the current position to the closest shrine and closest temple.
5. Store the minimum distance in a result list.
6. Finally, print the result list.
