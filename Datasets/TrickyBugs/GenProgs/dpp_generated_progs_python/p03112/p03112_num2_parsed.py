#Implementation
The problem can be solved in O(log(N+M)*Q) time using binary search. We can keep two lists of distances of shrines and temples, sorted in ascending order. For each query, we can find the distances of the closest shrines and temples that are located on the left and right sides of the current position. Then, we can calculate the minimum distance required by taking the minimum of the distances from the left shrine to the current position, from the right temple to the left shrine, and from the right temple to the current position.

# Dry Run
Let's dry run the first example to see how the program is working:

Input:
2 3 4
100
600
400
900
1000
150
2000
899
799

1. Construct the two lists of distances, shrines = [100, 600], temples = [400, 900, 1000].
2. For the first query x = 150:
   - Find the closest left shrine distance: left_shrine_dist = 100
   - Find the closest right temple distance: right_temple_dist = 400
   - Calculate the minimum distance: min_dist = min(150 - 100, 400 - 100, 400 - 150) = 350
   - Print min_dist: 350
3. Repeat step 2 for the remaining queries.

Output:
350
1400
301
399

# Conclusion
The program successfully solves the problem by finding the minimum distance required to visit a shrine and a temple for each query.
