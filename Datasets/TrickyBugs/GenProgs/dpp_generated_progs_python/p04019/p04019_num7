# PLAN

1. Count the occurrences of each direction in the string S.
2. Check if the number of occurrences of `N` is equal to the number of occurrences of `S`, and the number of occurrences of `W` is equal to the number of occurrences of `E`.
3. If the counts of `N` and `S` are equal and the counts of `W` and `E` are equal, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".

# Program

S = input().strip()
count_N = S.count("N")
count_S = S.count("S")
count_W = S.count("W")
count_E = S.count("E")

if count_N == count_S and count_W == count_E:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
