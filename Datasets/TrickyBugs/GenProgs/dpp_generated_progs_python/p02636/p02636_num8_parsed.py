# Approach:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of strings that can be obtained from the subarray of S starting from index `i` and having length `j`.

We will initialize the array `dp` with 0's. Then, for each index `i`, we will iterate over all possible lengths `j` from 1 to the remaining length of the subarray. For each `j`, we will consider two cases:
1. If the subarray `S[i:i+j]` has length 1, then `dp[i][j] = 1` because there is only one possible string that can be obtained, which is the subarray itself.
2. If the subarray `S[i:i+j]` has length greater than 1, then we can split it into two parts: `S[i:i+1]` and `S[i+1:i+j]`. The first part can be removed and the second part can be inserted anywhere in the remaining subarray `S[i+1:]`. So, the total number of strings that can be obtained from the subarray `S[i:i+j]` is the sum of `dp[i+1][k-1]` (where `k` is the length of the second part) for all possible lengths of the second part. We also need to add 1 to account for the possibility of not removing any characters.

Finally, the answer will be the sum of `dp[0][k]` for all possible lengths `k` of the subarray.

# Algorithm:
1. Initialize `dp` as a 2D array of size `(N+1)x(N+1)` with all values set to 0.
2. Iterate over the subarray lengths `j` from 1 to `N`.
3. For each length `j`, iterate over the starting index `i` from 0 to `N-j`.
   - If `j` is 1, set `dp[i][j]` to 1.
   - Otherwise, calculate `dp[i][j]` by summing up `dp[i+1][k-1]` for all valid values of `k` from 2 to `j+1`, and add 1.
4. Calculate the answer as the sum of `dp[0][k]` for all valid values of `k` from 1 to `N`.
5. Print the answer modulo 998244353.
