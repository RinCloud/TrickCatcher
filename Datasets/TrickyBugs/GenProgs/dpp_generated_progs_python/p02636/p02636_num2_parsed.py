# Solution:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming.

Let's define a 2-dimensional array dp, where dp[i][j] represents the number of strings that can be obtained by applying the operation on the substring S[i:j+1]. Here i and j are indexes of the characters in the string S.

Initially, all the elements of dp are set to 0, except the diagonal elements which are set to 1. This is because if i = j, then the substring contains only one character, and we cannot apply the operation on it.

Now, we can fill the dp array in a bottom-up manner using the following recurrence relation:

    dp[i][j] = dp[i+2][j] + dp[i+2][j-1] + dp[i+2][j-2] + ... + dp[i+2][i+2]

Here, dp[i+2][j] represents the number of strings that can be obtained if we remove the first two characters and the substring S[i+2:j+1] remains the same. Similarly, dp[i+2][j-1] represents the number of strings that can be obtained if we remove the first two characters and insert the third character somewhere in S[i+2:j+1], and so on.

The base case for the recurrence is when the substring S[i:j+1] has length less than 2, i.e., j <= i+1. In this case, dp[i][j] = 1, as we cannot apply the operation on the substring.

Finally, the answer to the problem is given by dp[0][n-1], where n is the length of the input string S.

# Plan:
1. Read the input string S from standard input.
2. Initialize the dp array with all elements set to 0, except the diagonal elements which are set to 1.
3. Iterate over the dp array in a bottom-up manner, filling it according to the recurrence relation.
4. Print the value of dp[0][n-1] modulo 998244353, where n is the length of S.
