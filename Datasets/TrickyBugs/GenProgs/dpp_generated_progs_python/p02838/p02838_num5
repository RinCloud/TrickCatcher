# Solution Approach:
We need to find the sum of all XOR pairs for the given list of integers `A`. 

To achieve this, we can iterate through each pair of integers `A_i` and `A_j`, where `i < j`, calculate their XOR value, and add it to a running sum. 

The modulo operation (10^9+7) can be performed at each step to keep the sum within the given constraints. 

Finally, we can print the resulting sum.

# Plan:
1. Read the input value of N.
2. Read the input list of integers A.
3. Initialize a sum variable to hold the running sum.
4. Iterate through each pair of integers A_i and A_j (i < j) and calculate their XOR value.
5. Add the XOR value to the sum variable.
6. Take modulo (10^9+7) of the sum variable at each step.
7. Print the resulting sum.

# Pseudo Code:

```python
N = int(input())

A = list(map(int, input().split()))

sum = 0

for i in range(N - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, N):
        xor_val = A[i] ^ A[j]
        sum += xor_val
        sum %= 1000000007

print(sum)
```

# Complexity Analysis:
The above solution has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the number of integers. This is because we need to iterate through each pair of integers to calculate their XOR value. Since the given constraints are satisfied, the solution should run within the time limits.
