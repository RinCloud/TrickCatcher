# Plan:
- Read the input values of N and the N-1 edges.
- Create an empty dictionary to store the vertices and their adjacent vertices.
- Iterate through the edges and add the adjacent vertices to each vertex in the dictionary.
- Iterate through all the vertices and find the maximum number of adjacent vertices.
- Print the maximum number of adjacent vertices + 1.
