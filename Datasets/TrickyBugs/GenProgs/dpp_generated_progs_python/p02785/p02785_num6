# Approach:
To minimize the number of Attacks, we need to prioritize using the Special Move on monsters with the highest health. 
Therefore, we sort the list of monster healths in descending order.
We then iterate through the sorted list of monster healths and perform the Special Move on the first K monsters.
Finally, we sum up the remaining healths of the monsters to get the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack.

# Code:
```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
H = list(map(int, input().split()))

H.sort(reverse=True)

counter = sum(H[K:])
print(counter)
```
