# Implementation Approach

The given problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the number of different possible combinations of integers on the blackboard after Snuke performs the operations considering the first i numbers with at most j operations.

Based on the problem constraints, the maximum possible value for i is 200 and the maximum possible value for j is 10^18. Hence, we need to optimize the solution to account for these constraints.

To solve the problem, we can iterate for each number in the given list and for each number, we can iterate from 0 to K to find the number of different combinations possible.

If the current element is x, then we can perform operations as follows:
- Operation A: Divide x by 2 until it becomes 0 or the number of operations (j) exhausts.
- Operation B: Subtract 1 from x until it becomes 0 or the number of operations (j) exhausts.

Let's implement this approach in code.
