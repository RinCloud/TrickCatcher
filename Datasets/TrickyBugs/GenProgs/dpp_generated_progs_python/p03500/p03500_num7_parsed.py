# Plan:
1. Read input values for N, K, and list of numbers.
2. Initialize two empty lists, `divided_by_two` and `minus_one`.
3. Iterate through each number in the list.
4. If the number is even, divide it by 2 and add it to `divided_by_two` list.
5. If the number is non-zero, subtract 1 from it and add it to `minus_one` list.
6. Sort both `divided_by_two` and `minus_one` in non-decreasing order.
7. Initialize a variable `result` as 1, to keep track of the number of combinations.
8. Iterate through the range of K, starting from 0.
9. For each iteration, calculate the number of combinations by adding the size of `minus_one` list to the result.
10. Update the `minus_one` list by subtracting 1 from each element (if the element is greater than 0).
11. Calculate the modulo of `result` with 1,000,000,007 and print it as the output.
