# Program

```
def gemstones(N, gems):
    max_earnings = 0
    for x in range(1, N+1):
        earnings = 0
        for i in range(1, N+1):
            if i % x != 0:
                earnings += gems[i-1]
        max_earnings = max(max_earnings, earnings)
    return max_earnings

N = int(input())
gems = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(gemstones(N, gems))
```

The `gemstones` function takes the number of gemstones `N` and a list of earnings `gems` as input. It iterates over all possible values of `x` from 1 to `N` and calculates the earnings when smashing all the gems that are not multiples of `x`. It keeps track of the maximum earnings obtained and returns the maximum earnings.

In the main part of the program, it reads the input values for `N` and `gems`. Then, it calls the `gemstones` function with the input values and prints the result.
