# Solution

### Approach

Let's start by counting the number of occurrences of each integer using a dictionary. We'll iterate through the list of balls and keep a count of the occurrences of each integer. Then, we can use this count to calculate the number of ways to choose two distinct balls with the same integer.

For each ball, we can calculate the number of ways by subtracting the count of that integer by 1. Since we are disregarding order, dividing the result by 2 will give us the number of ways to choose two distinct balls.

### Plan

1. Read the integer N from input.
2. Read the list of integers A from input.
3. Create an empty dictionary called `count` to store the count of occurrences for each integer.
4. Iterate through the list of balls, `A`, and update the count for each integer in `count`.
5. For each ball, print the number of ways to choose two distinct balls with the same integer, which is `(count[A[i]] - 1) // 2`.

Let's write the code now.

```python
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

count = {}

for ball in A:
    count[ball] = count.get(ball, 0) + 1

for i in range(N):
    print((count[A[i]] - 1) // 2)
```
