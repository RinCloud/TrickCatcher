# Solution
To solve this problem, we can use a recursive function. The function `count_patties` will take two parameters, `n` and `x`. If `n = 0`, it means we have reached the bottom level of the burger, so we return 0.

Otherwise, we need to check if `x` is less than or equal to the number of layers in a level `n-1` burger. In this case, the bottom-most `x` layers will only include patties from the level `n-1` burger, so we recursively call the `count_patties` function with `n-1` and `x-1`.

If `x` is greater than the number of layers in a level `n-1` burger plus 2, it means the bottom-most `x` layers will include all the layers from the level `n-1` burger plus the patty and the layers from another level `n-1` burger. So, we recursively call the `count_patties` function with `n-1` and `x-2`. Additionally, we need to add one to the result, because there is one patty in the current level.

If none of the above conditions match, it means the bottom-most `x` layers will include all the layers from the level `n-1` burger, the patty, and some layers from another level `n-1` burger, but not all layers. In this case, we need to subtract the number of layers in a level `n-1` burger from `x`, remove the patty, and then call the `count_patties` function with `n-1` and the updated `x` as parameters.

Finally, to count the number of patties from a level `n` burger, we need to call the `count_patties` function with `n` and `x`. The result will be the number of patties in the bottom-most `x` layers.

Here is the complete program:
