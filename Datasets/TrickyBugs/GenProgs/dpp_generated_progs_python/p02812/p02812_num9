# Approach:
To count the number of occurrences of `"ABC"` in the string `S` as contiguous subsequences, we can iterate through each character of `S` and check if it forms the desired subsequence `"ABC"`. Here is the complete program that implements this approach:

```python
# Read input values
N = int(input())
S = input()

# Initialize count
count = 0

# Iterate through each character of S
for i in range(N-2):
  # Check if current substring forms "ABC"
  if S[i:i+3] == "ABC":
    count += 1
    
# Print the count
print(count)
```

I hope the above program is helpful. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
