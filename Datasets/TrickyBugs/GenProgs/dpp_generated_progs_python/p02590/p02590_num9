# Explanation

1. Define a function `sum_of_products` that takes two arguments: `N` as the number of integers and `A` as the list of integers.
2. Inside the function, define a variable `P` with a value of 200003.
3. Define a variable `sum` with an initial value of 0 to store the sum of products.
4. Use nested loops to iterate over all possible pairs of integers in the list `A`.
   - The outer loop iterates from the first index `i` to the second-to-last index `N-1`.
   - The inner loop iterates from the next index `j` to the last index `N`.
   - This ensures that each pair of integers is considered exactly once, without repetition or ordering.
5. Inside the inner loop, calculate the product of the integers at indices `i` and `j`, and take the modulo of this product with `P`.
6. Add the calculated value to the variable `sum`.
7. After the loops, return the value of `sum`.
8. Get the input value of `N` from standard input and convert it to an integer using the `int()` function.
9. Get the input values of `A` from standard input as a space-separated string of integers, and convert it to a list of integers using the `split()` and `map()` functions.
10. Calculate the sum of products modulo `P` by calling the `sum_of_products` function with arguments `N` and `A`, and store the result in a variable `result`.
11. Print the value of `result` to standard output using the `print()` function.
