# Solution

The input consists of the height `H` and width `W` of the original image, followed by the `H` rows of `W` characters which represent the pixels.

To extend the image vertically, we can simply print each row of the original image twice.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
# Read the height and width of the original image
H, W = map(int, input().split())

# Read the original image
image = [input() for _ in range(H)]

# Print the extended image
for row in image:
    print(row)
    print(row)
```

This solution reads the input, stores the original image in a list, and then prints each row of the original image twice.

Note that the newline character is automatically added when printing, so there is no need to explicitly include it in the output.
