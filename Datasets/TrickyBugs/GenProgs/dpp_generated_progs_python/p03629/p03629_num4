# Program

```python
def shortest_non_subsequence(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ""

    # Check for each character from 'a' to 'z'
    for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z')+1):
        target = chr(c)
        idx = 0

        # Find the first occurrence of target character in s
        # starting from idx
        while idx < n and s[idx] != target:
            idx += 1

        # If target character is not found in s, then
        # it is the shortest non-subsequence
        if idx == n:
            ans = target
            break
    
    # If no non-subsequence is found, then empty string
    # is the shortest non-subsequence
    if ans == "":
        ans = ""

    return ans

# Read the input string
s = input()

# Find the shortest non-subsequence string
result = shortest_non_subsequence(s)

# Print the result
print(result)
```
Note: Your code should read input from standard input (e.g. using `input()` function) and write output to standard output (e.g. using `print()` function).
