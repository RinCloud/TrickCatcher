# Implementation

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest string that is not a subsequence of the given string A. In other words, we need to find the smallest string that contains at least one character that is not present in A.

We can approach this problem by iteratively trying all possible characters and checking if they form a subsequence of A. If a character does not form a subsequence, we can consider it as a candidate for the answer. Among all such candidates, we need to select the lexicographically smallest one.

To implement this approach, we can follow these steps:
1. Iterate over all lowercase English letters.
2. Check if the current letter is a subsequence of A.
3. If not, update the answer if it is the smallest lexicographically.
4. Finally, print the answer.

Let's implement this solution in the below python program:
