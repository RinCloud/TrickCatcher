# Here's a python program that will achieve the specified intention:

A = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Sort the tasks in ascending order
A.sort()

# Calculate the minimum cost
min_cost = 0

# Complete the first task for free
min_cost += A[1] - A[0]

# Complete the second task
min_cost += A[2] - A[1]

print(min_cost)
