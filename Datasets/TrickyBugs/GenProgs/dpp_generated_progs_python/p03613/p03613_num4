# Solution

To maximize the count of `i` such that `a_i = X`, we need to find the most occurring value in the given sequence `a`.

We can achieve this by counting the occurrences of each value in `a` and then finding the maximum count.

Here's the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

# Read the input
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Count the occurrences of each value in a
counts = Counter(a)

# Find the maximum count
max_count = max(counts.values())

# Print the maximum count
print(max_count)
```
