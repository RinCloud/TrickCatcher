# Approach:

To find the minimum possible number of different characters contained in the strings, we can observe that the lexicographically smallest string is formed by using the lowest possible characters in ascending order. Therefore, the number of different characters in the lexicographically smallest string will be equal to the length of the string.

We can calculate the minimum possible number of different characters by finding the minimum length among all the given strings.

# Steps:
1. Read the input values N and the lengths of the strings A_i.
2. Find the minimum length (min_length) among all the given strings.
3. Print the min_length as the minimum possible number of different characters contained in the strings.

# Note: We assume that the given input satisfies the given constraints.
