# Plan:
- Calculate the initial distance between Alice and the destination
- Iterate through the list of numbers and calculate the new distance after each move
- If the new distance is greater than the previous distance, it means Alice has gone past the destination
- If the new distance is equal to the destination, it means Alice has reached the destination
- For each plan, check if the new distance after modifying the specified number is greater than the previous distance or equal to the destination
