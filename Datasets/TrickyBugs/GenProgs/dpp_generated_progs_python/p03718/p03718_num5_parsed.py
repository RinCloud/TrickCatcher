# Plan:

1. Read the input values for H and W, and create an empty pond grid with the given dimensions.

2. Read the pond configuration and store it in the grid.

3. Find the positions of the leaves, frog (S), and target (T) in the pond grid.

4. Check if there is a direct path from S to T (i.e., they are in the same row or column). If so, print 0 and exit.

5. Iterate through each leaf position (excluding S and T) and check if removing that leaf would disconnect S from T.

6. If removing a leaf would disconnect S from T, continue to the next leaf position.

7. If removing a leaf does not disconnect S from T, print 1 and exit.

8. If no leaf removal allows S to reach T, print -1.
