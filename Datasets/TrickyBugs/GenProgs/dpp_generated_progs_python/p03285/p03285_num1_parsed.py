# You can determine if it is possible to buy some cakes and doughnuts for exactly N dollars by trying out all possible combinations of buying 2 or more cakes and 2 or more doughnuts.
# The algorithm is as follows:
# 1. Read the value of N from input.
# 2. Iterate through the number of cakes c from 0 to N/4 (since each cake costs 4 dollars).
#     a. Calculate the remaining amount m by subtracting c * 4 from N.
#     b. Calculate the number of doughnuts d by dividing m by 7 (since each doughnut costs 7 dollars).
#     c. If m can be exactly divided by 7 and d is greater than or equal to 2, print "Yes" and exit the loop.
# 3. If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, print "No".
