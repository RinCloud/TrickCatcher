# Plan
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use two priority queues to keep track of the next available balls for the A and B robots. We will sort the balls by their y-coordinate for A robots and x-coordinate for B robots. 

We will iterate over the balls and activate the A robot if it has a ball in its line, otherwise activate the B robot. We will increment the count of active A robots every time an A robot is activated and deactivate the A robot after collecting a ball. Similarly, we will increment the count of active B robots every time a B robot is activated and deactivate the B robot after collecting a ball.

Finally, we will calculate the number of possible orderings by multiplying the factorials of the counts of active A and B robots.

The solution will have a time complexity of O(N log N) due to the sorting of balls in the priority queues.

IMPLEMENTATION:
```python
import heapq
import math

MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Read input
N = int(input())
balls = []
for _ in range(2*N):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    balls.append((x, y))

# Sort balls by y-coordinate for A robots and x-coordinate for B robots
balls_A = sorted(balls, key=lambda ball: ball[1])
balls_B = sorted(balls, key=lambda ball: ball[0])

# Initialize priority queues for A and B robots
pq_A = []
pq_B = []
for i in range(1, N+1):
    heapq.heappush(pq_A, (balls_A[i-1][0], i))
    heapq.heappush(pq_B, (balls_B[i-1][1], i))

# Activate robots and count active A and B robots
cnt_A = 0
cnt_B = 0
ans = 1

for _ in range(2*N):
    if pq_A and pq_B:
        next_A = pq_A[0]
        next_B = pq_B[0]
        if next_A[1] < next_B[1]:
            heapq.heappop(pq_A)
            cnt_A += 1
            ans = (ans * cnt_A) % MOD
            heapq.heappop(pq_B)
        else:
            heapq.heappop(pq_B)
            cnt_B += 1
            ans = (ans * cnt_B) % MOD
            heapq.heappop(pq_A)
    elif pq_A:
        heapq.heappop(pq_A)
        cnt_A += 1
        ans = (ans * cnt_A) % MOD
    elif pq_B:
        heapq.heappop(pq_B)
        cnt_B += 1
        ans = (ans * cnt_B) % MOD

# Calculate the number of possible orderings
ans = (ans * math.factorial(N)) % MOD

# Print the result
print(ans)
