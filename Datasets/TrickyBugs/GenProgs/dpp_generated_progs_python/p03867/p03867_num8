# Solution
To find the number of sequences `a` that can be obtained after the procedure, we need to consider two cases:

Case 1: When `N` is even
In this case, the number of sequences `a` will be `K` raised to the power of half of the length of `a`.
So the number of sequences will be `pow(K, N/2, MOD)` where `MOD = 10^9+7`.

Case 2: When `N` is odd
In this case, the number of sequences `a` will be the product of `K` raised to the power of half of the length of `a` and `K` raised to the power of half of the length of `a` plus 1.
So the number of sequences will be `(pow(K, N/2, MOD) * pow(K, N/2 + 1, MOD)) % MOD`.

Finally, we need to return the number of sequences modulo `10^9+7`.

Here's the complete Python program that solves the problem:

```python
MOD = int(1e9) + 7

def count_sequences(N, K):
    # Check if N is even or odd
    if N % 2 == 0:
        return pow(K, N // 2, MOD)
    else:
        return (pow(K, N // 2, MOD) * pow(K, N // 2 + 1, MOD)) % MOD

# Read input
N, K = map(int, input().split())

# Count sequences
result = count_sequences(N, K)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

Now you can run the program and test it with the provided examples.
