# Plan:
1. Initialize a list `distances` with length N+2, with all elements set to 0.
2. Iterate over the given sightseeing spots in reverse order.
    3. Calculate the distance from the current spot to the next spot.
    4. Add the absolute difference of the current and next spot to `distances`.
5. Iterate over the given sightseeing spots in their original order.
    6. Calculate the distance from the previous spot to the current spot.
    7. Calculate the distance from the previous spot to the next spot.
    8. Calculate the distance from the current spot to the next spot.
    9. Subtract the absolute difference of the previous spot and next spot from `distances`.
    10. Add the absolute difference of the previous and current spot to `distances`.
    11. Print the value of `distances[i+1]`.
NOTE: The indices in the plan start from 0, so in the code we will have to adjust them accordingly.
