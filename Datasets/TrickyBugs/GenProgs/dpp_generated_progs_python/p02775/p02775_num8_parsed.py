# Approach:

To minimize the number of total banknotes used by you and the clerk, we need to choose the banknotes in the most optimal way. 

Let's start with the largest value banknote (10^(10^100)) and keep dividing the given value (N) by this banknote as many times as possible until the value becomes less than the banknote. This gives us the count of the largest banknote used. 

Then, we move on to the next largest banknote (10^(10^100-1)) and repeat the above process until we have considered all the banknotes. 

Finally, we add up the counts of all the banknotes used to get the minimum possible number of total banknotes.

# Algorithm:

1. Read the input value N.
2. Initialize a variable 'count' as 0 to keep track of the total number of banknotes used.
3. Initialize a variable 'currentBanknote' as 10^(10^100).
4. For each banknote in decreasing order (starting with the largest banknote):
   4.1. If N is greater than or equal to the current banknote:
       4.1.1. Calculate the count of the current banknote by dividing N by the current banknote and taking the floor value.
       4.1.2. Increment the 'count' by the count of the current banknote.
       4.1.3. Reduce the value of N by the product of count and the current banknote.
5. Print the 'count' as the minimum possible number of total banknotes used by you and the clerk.
