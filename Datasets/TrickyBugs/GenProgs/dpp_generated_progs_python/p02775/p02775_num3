# Program

## Steps:

1. Read the input value N
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the minimum number of banknotes used
3. Repeat the following steps until N becomes 0:
    - Find the maximum power of 10 that is less than or equal to N. Let's call it `power`.
    - Increment the `count` by N // 10^power
    - Subtract the value of the banknotes used from N. Update N as N - (N // 10^power) * 10^power

4. Finally, print the value of `count`

## Code:

```python
# Read the input value N
N = int(input())

# Initialize count
count = 0

# Calculate the minimum number of banknotes used
while N > 0:
    # Find the maximum power of 10 that is less than or equal to N
    power = len(str(N)) - 1
    # Increment count by N // 10^power
    count += N // 10 ** power
    # Subtract the value of banknotes used from N
    N -= (N // 10 ** power) * 10 ** power

# Print the minimum number of banknotes used
print(count)
```

By running this program, you can calculate the minimum possible number of total banknotes used by you and the clerk.
