# Plan
To minimize the distance traveled, AtCoDeer should start and end his travel at the house with the median coordinate. 

1. Read the value of N.
2. Read the coordinates of the houses and store them in a list.
3. Sort the list of coordinates in ascending order.
4. Calculate the index of the median coordinate.
5. Calculate the distance between the first house and the median coordinate.
6. Calculate the distance between the last house and the median coordinate.
7. Print the maximum distance among the two calculated distances.
