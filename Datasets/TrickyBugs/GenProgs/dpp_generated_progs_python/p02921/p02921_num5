# Given code

```python
# Read the weather forecast for three days in the past
S = input().strip()

# Read the actual weather on those three days
T = input().strip()

# Initialize a variable to store the number of correct forecasts
correct_forecasts = 0

# Check if the forecast was correct for each day
for i in range(3):
    if S[i] == T[i]:
        correct_forecasts += 1

# Print the number of correct forecasts
print(correct_forecasts)
```
