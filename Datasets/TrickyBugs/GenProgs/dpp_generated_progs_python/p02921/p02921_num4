# Given two strings S and T representing the forecast and the actual weather, we need to determine the number of days for which the forecast was correct.

# Read the forecast and actual weather from input
S = input()
T = input()

# Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of correct forecasts
correct_forecasts = 0

# Check each day in the forecast
for i in range(3):
    # If the forecast matches the actual weather, increment the correct_forecasts count
    if S[i] == T[i]:
        correct_forecasts += 1

# Print the number of correct forecasts
print(correct_forecasts)
