# Solution

The problem asks us to find the smallest pair `(A,B)` such that we can construct a Christmas Tree with `N` vertices and `N-1` edges.

To solve this problem, we can iterate over all possible values of `A` and `B` starting from `A=1` and `B=0`. For each `A` and `B`, we will try to construct a Christmas Tree and check if it is valid.

To construct a Christmas Tree, we will use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will start by selecting two vertices `x` and `y` that belong to different connected components and combine them into one vertex. We will repeat this process until we have a single connected tree.

To check if a Christmas Tree is valid, we will perform a BFS (breadth-first search) starting from the root vertex and check if the length of the shortest path from the root to any leaf vertex is less than or equal to `B`.

If we find a valid Christmas Tree, we will store the current values of `A` and `B` as the smallest lexicographically pair. Finally, we will print the smallest pair `(A, B)`.

# Approach

1. Read the input values of `N` and the edges `(a, b)`.
2. Initialize the smallest pair `(smallest_A, smallest_B)` with `(N-1, 0)`.
3. Iterate over all possible values of `A` from `1` to `N-1`.
   1. Set the range of possible values for `B` from `A` to `N-1`.
   2. Iterate over all possible values of `B` from `A` to `N-1`.
      1. Initialize an empty adjacency list `adj_list` to represent the graph.
      2. Construct the adjacency list `adj_list` using the input edges `(a, b)`.
      3. Initialize an empty list `visited` to keep track of visited vertices during BFS.
      4. Initialize a queue `queue` and enqueue the root vertex `1`.
      5. Initialize a variable `max_distance` to keep track of the maximum distance from the root vertex.
      6. While the queue is not empty:
         1. Dequeue a vertex `v` from the queue.
         2. Mark `v` as visited.
         3. For each adjacent vertex `u` of `v`:
            1. If `u` is not visited:
               1. Enqueue `u`.
               2. Update the maximum distance if the distance from the root to `u` is greater than `max_distance`.
      7. If `max_distance` is less than or equal to `B`:
         1. If `A` is smaller than `smallest_A` or `A` is equal to `smallest_A` and `B` is smaller than `smallest_B`:
            1. Set `smallest_A` to `A` and `smallest_B` to `B`.
4. Print the smallest pair `(smallest_A, smallest_B)`.
