# Plan:
# 1. Read the grid dimensions H and W from input
# 2. Read the H strings representing the grid squares from input
# 3. Create an empty result grid of the same dimensions
# 4. Iterate over each grid square
#       - If square is bomb, keep it as is in result grid
#       - If square is empty, count adjacent bombs and update square in result grid
# 5. Print the result grid
