# Approach
To maximize the number of points, we can rearrange the cards in such a way that the three leftmost cards always have the same integer written on them. We can achieve this by counting the occurrences of each integer and selecting the integer with the maximum count.

# Steps
1. Read the value of N from input.
2. Read the list of integers from input.
3. Initialize a dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer.
4. Iterate through the list of integers and update the count in the dictionary.
5. Find the integer with the maximum count.
6. Calculate the maximum points using the formula: `max_points = count[max_integer] - 1`
7. Print the maximum points.
