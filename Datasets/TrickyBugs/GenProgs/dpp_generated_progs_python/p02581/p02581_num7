# Implementation

## Steps:
1. Read the input value for `N`.
2. Read the array `A` containing the values of the cards.
3. Create a dictionary `count` to keep track of the frequency of each number in the `A` array.
4. Initialize the variables `points` and `multiplier` to keep track of the total points and additional multiplier points respectively.
5. Iterate `i` over the range from 1 to `N+1` (exclusive).
    - Set the initial value of `max_points` to 0 to store the maximum points in the current iteration.
    - Iterate `j` over the range from 1 to `i` (exclusive).
        - Calculate the score for the current iteration by considering each possible arrangement of the leftmost 5 cards.
        - Remove the three leftmost cards from the `A` array.
        - If the integers written on those three cards are all equal, increment `max_points` by 1.
        - Restore the original `A` array for the next iteration.
    - Update the maximum points if the current `max_points` is greater than the maximum points so far.
6. Print the total points obtained by adding the maximum points and the multiplier points.

## Let's write the code now.

```python
# Step 1: Read the input value for N
N = int(input())

# Step 2: Read the array A containing the values of the cards
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Step 3: Create a dictionary count to keep track of the frequency of each number in the A array
count = {}

# Step 4: Initialize the variables points and multiplier
points = 0
multiplier = 0

# Step 5: Iterate i over the range from 1 to N+1
for i in range(1, N+1):
    # Set the initial value of max_points to 0
    max_points = 0
    
    # Iterate j over the range from 1 to i
    for j in range(1, i):
        # Calculate the score for the current iteration
        score = 0
        
        # Temporary array to store the modified A array
        tempA = A[:]
        
        # Remove the three leftmost cards from the A array
        del tempA[:3]
        
        # If the integers written on those three cards are all equal, increment max_points by 1
        if tempA[0] == tempA[1] == tempA[2]:
            max_points += 1
        
        # Restore the original A array for the next iteration
        A = A[3:] + A[:3]
    
    # Update the maximum points if the current max_points is greater than the maximum points so far
    points += max_points
    
    # Update the multiplier points if the current max_points is equal to i-1
    if max_points == i-1:
        multiplier = max_points

# Step 6: Print the total points obtained by adding the maximum points and the multiplier points
print(points + multiplier)
