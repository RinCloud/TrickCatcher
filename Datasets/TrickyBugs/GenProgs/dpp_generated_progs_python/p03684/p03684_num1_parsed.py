# Approach:

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum necessary amount of money to build roads such that we can travel between every pair of towns by traversing roads. We can achieve this by finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the given towns.

1. First, we need to calculate the distance between each pair of towns. We can use the formula min(|a-c|,|b-d|) to calculate the distance between two towns at coordinates (a,b) and (c,d).

2. Next, we need to construct the MST using the calculated distances. We can use Prim's algorithm or Kruskal's algorithm to construct the MST.

3. Finally, we need to sum up the costs of all the roads in the MST to get the minimum necessary amount of money.
