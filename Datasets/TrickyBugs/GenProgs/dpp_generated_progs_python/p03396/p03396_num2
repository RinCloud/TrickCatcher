# PLAN
- Calculate the time required to travel from one shopping center to the next and back to the starting point.
- Iterate through each shopping center and calculate the total time required to visit all shopping centers.
- Print the minimum time required.

# Approach
- The time required to travel from one shopping center to the next and back to the starting point is equal to the distance between the two shopping centers multiplied by 2.
- Iterate through each shopping center and calculate the total time required to visit all shopping centers.
- The total time is the sum of the time required to travel from one shopping center to the next and the time required to shop at that shopping center.
- Finally, add the time required to travel from the last shopping center back to the starting point.

```python
N, L = map(int, input().split()) # read N and L

shopping_centers = list(map(int, input().split())) # read shopping center coordinates

shopping_times = list(map(int, input().split())) # read shopping times

total_time = shopping_centers[0] * 2 # time to travel to the first shopping center and back to the starting point

for i in range(N-1):
    total_time += (shopping_centers[i+1] - shopping_centers[i]) * 2 + shopping_times[i+1] # time to travel to the next shopping center and back plus the shopping time

total_time += (L - shopping_centers[-1]) * 2 # time to travel from the last shopping center back to the starting point

print(total_time)
```
