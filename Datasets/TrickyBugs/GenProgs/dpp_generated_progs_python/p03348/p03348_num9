# I will define a Node class to represent each vertex in the tree
# Each Node object will have a label, a list of its children, and a parent
# I will create a function to build the tree from the input
# I will create a function to calculate the colorfulness of a tree
# I will use backtracking to try all possible ways to color the tree
# I will calculate the colorfulness and the number of leaves for each coloring
# I will keep track of the minimum colorfulness and the minimum number of leaves
# I will print the minimum colorfulness and the minimum number of leaves
