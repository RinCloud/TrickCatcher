# Approach

We can use a set to keep track of the boxes that may contain the red ball. Initially, only box 1 contains the red ball, so we add box 1 to the set.
Then, for each operation, we remove the source box from the set (since we know that it does not contain the red ball anymore) and add the target box to the set (since we know that it may contain the red ball now).

Finally, we print the size of the set, which represents the number of boxes that may contain the red ball.
