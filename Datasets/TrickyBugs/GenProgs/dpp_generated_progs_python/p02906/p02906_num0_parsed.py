# Plan

To determine if there exists a graph that matches Snuke's memory, we can try to construct a graph based on the given clues. If we are able to construct a graph that satisfies all the clues, then the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, the answer is "No".

First, let's create an adjacency list to represent the graph. We can initialize an empty list for each vertex.

For each clue, if C_i is 0, we add the edge (A_i, B_i) to the adjacency list.

If C_i is 1, we need to add more than one simple path between A_i and B_i in the graph. One way to achieve this is to add an additional temporary vertex T to the graph, and add the edges (A_i, T) and (T, B_i) to the adjacency list.

Finally, we need to check if the constructed graph satisfies the given number of vertices and edges, i.e., if the length of the adjacency list for each vertex is less than or equal to the maximum number of possible edges for that vertex.

If the constructed graph satisfies all the conditions, then the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, the answer is "No".

Let's implement this in the code:
