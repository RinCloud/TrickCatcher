# Algorithm:
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming.
Let's create a 2D array dp of size N+1 x M+1, where dp[i][j] represents the number of sequences of length i which have their product equal to j.

To calculate dp[i][j], we can consider two possibilities:
1. If we do not include the number i in the sequence, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]. This means we are not using i in the sequence and the product remains the same as the product of the previous i-1 numbers.

2. If we include the number i in the sequence, then dp[i][j] = dp[i][j//i]. This means the product becomes j//i (integer division) and we still have to find the remaining i-1 numbers with the product j//i.

The final result will be the sum of dp[N][1] to dp[N][M].

# Time Complexity Analysis:
Creating the dp array takes O(N*M) time.
Calculating the final result by summing up the elements of dp[N][1] to dp[N][M] takes O(M) time.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(N*M).

# Program:

```python
# Constants
MOD = int(1e9) + 7

# Read input
N, M = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize dp array
dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]

# Base case: dp[i][1] = 1 for all i
for i in range(N + 1):
    dp[i][1] = 1

# Fill dp array using dynamic programming
for i in range(2, N + 1):
    for j in range(2, M + 1):
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j // i] + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD

# Calculate the final result
result = sum(dp[N][1:M+1]) % MOD

# Print the result
print(result)
```
