#Approach
To count the number of possible pairs, we will iterate through all possible values of u and v, and check if there exist two non-negative integers a and b such that a xor b equals to u and a+b equals to v.

The maximum value of N is 10^18, so iterating through all possible values of u and v is not feasible. Instead, we can use a mathematical approach to find the number of possible pairs.

Let's observe the possible values of u and v:

u = a xor b
v = a + b

Let's simplify the equations:

a = (u + v) / 2
b = v - a

Now, we need to find the values of a and b such that they are non-negative integers. For this, the following two conditions should be satisfied:

1. (u + v) is even
2. v - a is non-negative (i.e., v >= a)

We can use these conditions to find the number of possible values of u and v.

Let's implement this approach in code.
