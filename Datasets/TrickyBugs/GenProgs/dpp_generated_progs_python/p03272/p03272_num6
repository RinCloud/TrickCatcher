# Given the number of cars in a train N and an integer i, we need to find the value of j such that the i-th car from the front of the train is the j-th car from the back.

# Read the input values N and i
N, i = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the value of j using the formula j = N + 1 - i
j = N + 1 - i

# Print the value of j
print(j)
