# Nakahashi has to keep track of his current position on the counter, the current energy consumed, and the maximum nutrition taken in minus the total energy consumed.
# Initially, Nakahashi's current position is 0 and the current energy consumed is 0.

# We need to iterate through each sushi on the counter and calculate the maximum nutrition taken in minus the total energy consumed at each sushi position.

# Nakahashi can walk clockwise or counterclockwise. We need to calculate the maximum nutrition taken in minus the total energy consumed for both directions and take the maximum of the two.

# To calculate the maximum nutrition taken in minus the total energy consumed for a specific sushi position, we need to consider two cases:
# Case 1: Nakahashi walks clockwise starting from the current position to eat all sushi in that direction.
# Case 2: Nakahashi walks counterclockwise starting from the current position to eat all sushi in that direction.

# Finally, we need to print the maximum nutrition taken in minus the total energy consumed.

# Let's implement this solution
