MODIFICATIONS MADE:
The given program intention is quite complex, involving multiple steps and calculations. To make it more manageable, I will start by implementing a function that will take the input values and return the result.

The function will first initialize the total number of ways as 1. Then, it will iterate over each column and calculate the number of ways to paint the squares based on the given conditions. Finally, it will return the total number of ways modulo 10^9+7.

I will begin by writing the main function according to the modifications.
