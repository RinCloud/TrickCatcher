# Approach:
- Initialize `min_unbalancedness` to infinity.
- Iterate over all possible replacements of `?` with `0` or `1`. We can generate all possible combinations using a binary counter.
- For each combination, calculate the unbalancedness of the resulting string and update `min_unbalancedness` if the current unbalancedness is smaller.
- Finally, print `min_unbalancedness`.

# Implementation:
