# Solution

To achieve the minimum possible unbalancedness of S', we can iterate through each `?` in the string S and replace it with `0` or `1` such that the number of occurrences of `0` and `1` are as close to each other as possible.

We will keep track of the count of `0`s and `1`s encountered so far. For each `?`, we can try replacing it with `0` or `1` and update the count accordingly. Then, we can calculate the unbalancedness at that point and keep track of the minimum value encountered so far.

Here is the Python program that implements this logic:

```python
def minimum_unbalancedness(S):
    count_0 = 0  # count of 0s encountered so far
    count_1 = 0  # count of 1s encountered so far
    min_unbalancedness = float('inf')  # minimum unbalancedness encountered so far

    for c in S:
        if c == '0':
            count_0 += 1
        elif c == '1':
            count_1 += 1
        else:  # c == '?', try replacing with 0 and 1
            min_unbalancedness = min(min_unbalancedness, abs(count_0 - count_1 + 1), abs(count_0 - count_1 - 1))
            count_0 += 1

    return min_unbalancedness

# Read the input string
S = input().strip()

# Call the function and print the result
print(minimum_unbalancedness(S))
```

This program takes the input string from the standard input and prints the minimum possible unbalancedness of S'.
