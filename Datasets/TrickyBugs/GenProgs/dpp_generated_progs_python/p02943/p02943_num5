# Program

**Explanation:**

To find the lexicographically smallest possible string after K operations, we can perform the reverse and concatenation operation and then repeat the process.

1. Initialize a variable `s` with the given string `S`.
2. Repeat the following steps `K` times:
   - Reverse the string and assign it to `t`.
   - Concatenate `s` and `t` and assign it back to `s`.
3. Finally, print the lexicographically smallest substring of `s` with length `N`.

**Python code:**

```python
N, K = map(int, input().split())
S = input()

s = S

for i in range(K):
    t = s[::-1]
    s = s + t

lexicographically_smallest_substring = s[:N]
print(lexicographically_smallest_substring)
```
