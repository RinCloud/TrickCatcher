# Plan

- I will store the position of each viewer in a 2D list called `seats`.
- I will iterate over the sequence of viewers leaving the cinema.
- For each viewer, I will find the minimum number of viewers that will hate her forever.
- I will count the total number of pairs of viewers that hate each other and print the result.
