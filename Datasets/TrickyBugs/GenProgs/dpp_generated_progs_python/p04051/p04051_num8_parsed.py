# PLAN
- Create a dictionary to keep tally of the number of each combination of beef and green pepper
- For each skewer meal pack, calculate the combinations of beef and green pepper that can be paired with it
- Increment the tally in the dictionary for each combination
- Calculate the total number of different ways Snuke can make a skewer meal by multiplying the tallies in the dictionary
- Print the result modulo 10^9+7
