**Repaired code**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a, b, c, mon, ans = 0;
  cin >> a >> b >> c;
  
  for(int i = 0; i < a; i++) {
    cin >> mon;
    for(int m = 0; m < b; m += mon) {
      ans += 1;
    }
  }
  
  cout << ans + c << endl;
}
```
Explanation:
1. Initialized `ans` variable to 0.
2. Added braces {} for the outer and inner loops, for better code readability.
3. Added spaces around the assignment, comparison and arithmetic operators to improve code readability.
