The code has two bugs:
1. The variables A and B are not initialized to 0, which will result in undefined behavior when trying to increment their values.
2. The sort function is sorting the elements in descending order, but in order to maximize Alice's score, we want to sort the elements in ascending order.

Here is the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int N, A = 0, B = 0;
  cin >> N;
  vector<int> S(N);
  for(int i=0;i<N;i++) cin >> S[i];
  sort(S.begin(), S.end());
  for(int i=0;i<N;i+=2){
    A+=S[i], B+=S[i+1];
  }
  cout << A-B << endl;
}
```
