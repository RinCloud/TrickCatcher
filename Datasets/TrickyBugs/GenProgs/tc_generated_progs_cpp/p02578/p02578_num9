**UPDATED CODE**:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    long long int n, a, aa, ans = 0;
    cin >> n;
    cin >> aa;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a;
        if (aa > a) {
            ans += aa - a;
        } else {
            aa = a;
        }
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. Added the missing variable "n" to store the number of persons.
2. Moved the first input "cin >> aa" outside of the while loop so that it doesn't get skipped.
3. Replaced the while loop with a for loop to iterate through the remaining inputs.
