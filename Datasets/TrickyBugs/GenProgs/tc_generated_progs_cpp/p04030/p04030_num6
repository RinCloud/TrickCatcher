**COMMENTS**:
- The code is missing the necessary `iostream` header which includes input/output stream functionality. This header needs to be added to the code.
- The array `a` is used to store the resulting string, but it is not null-terminated. This means that when the resulting string is printed, it may print garbage values beyond the intended output. To fix this, the array `a` needs to be null-terminated by adding a `'\0'` character at the end after all the characters have been inserted.
- The variable `i` is used to keep track of the index where the next character should be inserted in the `a` array. Since it is uninitialized, it can have any value at the start of the loop. To fix this, `i` should be initialized to 0 at the beginning.
- The loop condition `f[j]!=0` is checking for the null character `'\0'` to determine the end of the input string `f`. However, the input string `f` does not necessarily need to be null-terminated (since `cin` automatically takes care of that), so this condition is incorrect. To fix this, the loop condition should be `f[j]!='\0'` instead.
- The logic for handling the backspace key is incorrect. Instead of deleting the rightmost letter of the string, it is currently deleting the leftmost letter. To fix this, `i` should be decremented (`i--`) before assigning `0` to `a[i]`.
- The array `f` is used to store the input string, but it is not necessary to use a separate array for that. The input string can be directly read into the `a` array instead.
- The final output should be displayed as a string, not as a character array. To fix this, the line `cout<<a;` should be changed to `cout<<a<<endl;`.

**REPAIRED CODE**:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	char a[11],i=0;
	cin>>a;
	for(int j=0;a[j]!='\0';j++){
		if(a[j]=='1'){
			a[i]='1';
			i++;
		}else if(a[j]=='0'){
			a[i]='0';
			i++;
		}else{
			i=max(0,i-1);
			a[i]=0;
		}
	}
	a[i] = '\0';
	cout<<a<<endl;
	return 0;
}
```
