**CORRECTED CODE**:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  int sum =0;
  
  if(N % 10 !=0){
    while(N>0) {
      sum += N % 10;
      N /= 10;
    }
  }
  else sum = 1; // Changed from 10 to 1
  cout << sum << endl;
}
```

Explanation: 
The bug in the original code is at line 17, where the sum is set to 10 when N is divisible by 10. The correct value should be 1, because the sum of the digits of A and B cannot be 10.
