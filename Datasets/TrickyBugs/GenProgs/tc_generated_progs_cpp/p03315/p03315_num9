**PROBLEM DESCRIPTION**:
There is always an integer in Takahashi's mind.
Initially, the integer in Takahashi's mind is 0. Takahashi is now going to eat four symbols, each of which is `+` or `-`. When he eats `+`, the integer in his mind increases by 1; when he eats `-`, the integer in his mind decreases by 1.
The symbols Takahashi is going to eat are given to you as a string S. The i-th character in S is the i-th symbol for him to eat.
Find the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols.

CONSTRAINTS:
* The length of S is 4.
* Each character in S is `+` or `-`.

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

OUTPUT:
Print the integer in Takahashi's mind after he eats all the symbols.

EXAMPLES:

INPUT:
+-++

OUTPUT:
2

INPUT:
-+--

OUTPUT:
-2

INPUT:
----

OUTPUT:
-4

**CODE**:
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	string s;
	int a = 0;
	cin >> s;
	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
		if (s[i] == '+')
		    a += 1;
		if (s[i] == '-')
		    a -= 1;
	}
	cout << a;
}
```
