**FAULTS**
1. Initializing `max` and `min` to 0 is incorrect because the given constraints say all values in the input are integers between 1 and 200000. So initializing them as 0 will cause incorrect results.
2. In the second for loop, we should be printing the maximum value among the N-1 elements other than A_i, but the code is printing `min` when `a[i]` is equal to `max`. This logic is incorrect.
3. The code fails to handle cases where there are multiple elements with the maximum value. The code should consider all elements except A_i and find the maximum from them.

**SOLUTION**
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  int N, i;
  scanf("%d", &N);
  
  int a[N];
  for(i = 0; i < N; i++){
    scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  }
  
  for(i = 0; i < N; i++){
    int max = -1;
    for(int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      if(i != j && a[j] > max){
        max = a[j];
      }
    }
    printf("%d\n", max);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
