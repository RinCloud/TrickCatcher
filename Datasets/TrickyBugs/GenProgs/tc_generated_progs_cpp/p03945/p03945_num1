**CORRECTED CODE**:

```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
char a[100005];
int main()
{
	cin>>a;
	int len=strlen(a),ans=0;
	for(int i=1;i<len;i++)
		if(a[i]!=a[i-1])
			ans++;
	cout<<ans<<endl;
	return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**: 
The issue in the original code was that the variable `ans` was not initialized. This caused unpredictable behavior as the value of `ans` was not set. To fix this, we need to initialize `ans` to 0 before the loop.
