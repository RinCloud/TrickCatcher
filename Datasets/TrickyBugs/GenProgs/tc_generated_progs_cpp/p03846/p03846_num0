**BUGS/LOGIC FLAWS**:

1. The array `d` is declared to have a size of 100001, which is greater than the maximum value of N, causing memory wastage.

2. The loop to read the values of A_i is incorrect. It should iterate from 1 to N, but it currently iterates from 0 to N-1.

3. The loop to calculate the number of possible orders has a logical flaw. It only checks the counts of people with a difference of j to the right, but it doesn't check the counts of people with a difference of j to the left.

4. The check for the case when all people are standing in the middle (difference of 0) is incorrect. It currently only checks if there is exactly one person in the middle, but it should also check if there are no people with a difference of 0 to the left or to the right.

5. The check for the case when all people have a difference of 2 is incorrect. It currently checks for any value of j that has a count of 2, but it should check if all values of j have a count of 2.

**CORRECTED CODE**:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define MOD 1000000007
using namespace std;
int main(){
  cin.tie(0);
  ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int ans = 1;
  vector<int> d(n + 1, 0);
  bool flag = true;

  for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    d[a]++;
  }

  for(int j = 1; j < n && flag; j++){
    if(d[j] != 2){
      flag = false;
    }
    ans = (ans * 2) % MOD;
  }

  if(d[0] != 1 || d[n] != 1){
    flag = false;
  }

  for(int i = 1; i <= n/2; i++){
    if(d[i] != 2){
      flag = false;
      break;
    }
  }

  if(flag){
    cout << ans << endl;
  }else{
    cout << 0 << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
```
