**Repaired Code**:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  string s;
  cin>>s;
  s[0] = '2';
  s[1] = '0';
  s[2] = '1';
  s[3] = '8';
  cout<<s;
}
```

**Explanation**:

In the original code, we can see that the characters in the string `s` are directly changed in the `cout` statement, which doesn't modify the original string `s` itself. So, we need to modify the first four characters directly in the `s` string before printing it.
