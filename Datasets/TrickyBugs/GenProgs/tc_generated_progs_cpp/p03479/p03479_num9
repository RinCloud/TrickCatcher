**INCORRECT CODE**
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	long long int x,y,cnt;
	cin>>x>>y;
	while(x<=y)
	{
		x=x*2;
		cnt++;
	}
	cout<<cnt<<endl;
}
```

**ERRORS / BUGS**
- The variable `cnt` is uninitialized. Its initial value should be set to 0 before the loop.
- The loop condition should be `x < y`, not `x <= y`. Otherwise, if `x == y`, the loop will iterate one extra time.
- The loop increments `x` by multiplying it by 2 on each iteration. This means `x` will continue to increase until it becomes greater than `y`. However, the sequence `A` must be between `x` and `y` (inclusive), so the while loop condition should be `x*2 <= y`.
- The loop should break as soon as `x` becomes greater than `y`.

**CORRECTED CODE**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	long long int x, y, cnt = 0;
	cin >> x >> y;
	while (x <= y*2)
	{
		x = x * 2;
		cnt++;
		if (x > y)
			break;
	}
	cout << cnt << endl;
}
```
