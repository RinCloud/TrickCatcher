**Repaired code**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	long long int x, y, cnt = 0;
	cin >> x >> y;
	while (x <= y)
	{
		x = x * 2;
		cnt++;
	}
	cout << cnt << endl;
}
```

**Explanation**:

The code has a bug. The `cnt` variable is not initialized before the while loop. As a result, its initial value is undefined and can lead to incorrect output. 

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `cnt` to 0 before the while loop.
