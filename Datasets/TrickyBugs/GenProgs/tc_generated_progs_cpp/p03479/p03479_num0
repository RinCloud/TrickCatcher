**NEW CODE**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    long long int x, y, cnt = 0;
    cin >> x >> y;
    while (x <= y)
    {
        x = x * 2;
        cnt++;
    }
    cout << cnt << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

There was a bug in the original code where the variable `cnt` was not initialized before its first use. I fixed it by initializing `cnt` to 0.
