**CORRECTED CODE**:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int N;
    cin >> N;

    int count = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++) 
    {
        if(to_string(i).length() % 2 != 0)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }

    cout << count;

    return 0;
}
```

The issue with the given code is that `ss` variable is being used without initializing it. Additionally, the logic in the `if` statement to check for numbers with odd digits is flawed.

I have corrected the code by initializing `count` variable and modified the condition in the `if` statement to check if the length of the number's string representation is odd.
