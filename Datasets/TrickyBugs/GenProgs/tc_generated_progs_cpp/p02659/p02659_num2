**REPAIRED CODE**:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
long A;
double B;
int main()
{
  cin>>A>>B;
  int T = B * 100;
  cout<<A*T/100<<endl;
}
```

**NOTE**:
In the original code, the variable `B` is declared as a string. However, the given constraints specify that `B` should be a number with two digits after the decimal point. Therefore, it makes more sense to declare `B` as a `double` instead. Additionally, to compute the value of `T`, we can simply multiply `B` by 100 to convert it into an integer with two digits after the decimal point.
