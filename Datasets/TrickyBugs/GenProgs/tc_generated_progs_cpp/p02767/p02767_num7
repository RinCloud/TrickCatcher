**BUG FIX**

1. The bug is in the array indexing. The array `a` is being accessed from index 1 to n, but in C++ arrays are 0-based, so it should be accessed from index 0 to n-1.

2. In the loop to calculate `x` and `y`, the indexes are incorrect and should be corrected to start from 0 and end at n-1.

3. In the loop to calculate `x` and `y`, the formula to calculate the minimum total stamina is incorrect. The correct formula is `(X_i - P)^2`, where P is the average of all X_i values.

**REPAIRED CODE**

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main(){
  ll n,b,x,y,i;
  cin >> n;
  ll a[n];
  b=0;
  for(i=0;i<n;i++){
    cin >> a[i];
    b+=a[i];
  }
  b=b/n;
  x=0;
  y=0;
  for(i=0;i<n;i++){
    x+=(a[i]-b)*(a[i]-b);
    y+=(a[i]-b+1)*(a[i]-b+1);
  }
  cout << min(x,y);
}
