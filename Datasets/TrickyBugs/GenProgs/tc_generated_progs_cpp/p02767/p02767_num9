**Repaired code**:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;

int main(){
  ll n,b,x,y,i;
  cin >> n;
  ll a[n];
  b=0;
  for(i=0;i<n;i++){
    cin >> a[i];
    b+=a[i];
  }
  b=b/n;
  x=0;
  y=0;
  for(i=0;i<n;i++){
    x+=(a[i]-b)*(a[i]-b);
    y+=(a[i]-b+1)*(a[i]-b+1);
  }
  cout << min(x,y);
}
```

The issue in the original code was in the `for` loop. The indexing of the array was starting from 1 instead of 0. Hence, I changed the loop indexing from `i=1` to `i=0` and `i<=n` to `i<n`.

Another issue was in the equation `y+=(a[i]-b-1)*(a[i]-b-1);`. The correct equation should have been `y+=(a[i]-b+1)*(a[i]-b+1);` since the meeting can be held at any integer coordinate.

I also added the necessary header file `<bits/stdc++.h>` for the code to compile successfully.
