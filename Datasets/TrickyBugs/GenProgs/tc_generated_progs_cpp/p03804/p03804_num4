Explanation: 
1. The original code was missing the initialization of cnt variable for each new start point. This could lead to incorrect counting and false positives.
2. The original code was using "<" instead of "<=" in the outer two "for" loops to iterate through all possible start points in the image A. This is incorrect because if the template image B has dimensions MxM, then the number of possible start points in image A is (N-M+1) x (N-M+1), since the template image can fit in A at least N-M+1 times horizontally and N-M+1 times vertically.
3. The repaired code initializes cnt to 0 in the outer "for" loop, and uses "<=" instead of "<" in the outer two "for" loops to iterate through all possible start points in the image A.
