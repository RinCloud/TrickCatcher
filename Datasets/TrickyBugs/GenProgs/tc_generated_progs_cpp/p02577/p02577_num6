**REPAIRED CODE**:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string S;
  cin >> S;
  int ans = 0;
  for (char a : S) ans += a - '0';
  cout << ((ans % 9 == 0) ? "Yes" : "No") << "\n";
}
```

**Explanation:**
- In the original code, `% 3` is used to check whether the sum of digits is divisible by 9. This is incorrect, as checking `% 3` checks divisibility by 3 but not by 9.
- I have replaced `% 3` with `% 9` to determine if the sum of digits is divisible by 9.
- Additionally, I have changed the output strings to correctly indicate whether the number is divisible by 9.
