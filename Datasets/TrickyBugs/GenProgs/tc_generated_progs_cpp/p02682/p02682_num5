**Repaired code**:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int a,b,c,k;	cin>>a>>b>>c>>k;

	if(k<=a){
	  cout<<k<<endl;
	}
	else if(k<=a+b){
	  cout<<a<<endl;
	}
	else{
	  cout<<a-(k-(a+b))<<endl;
	}

	return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:

The original code wrongly assumes that if `k <= a`, then the maximum possible sum of the numbers written on the cards chosen is `k`. But that is not correct. If `k <= a`, we can pick all the `k` cards from the cards with the number `1`. So the maximum sum in this case is `k`.

The repaired code checks three cases:

1. If `k <= a`, we can pick all the `k` cards from the cards with the number `1`. So the maximum sum is `k`.
2. If `k > a` and `k <= a + b`, we can pick all the `a` cards (cards with the number `1`) and some of the `k - a` cards from the cards with the number `0`. So the maximum sum is `a`.
3. If `k > a + b`, we can pick all the `a` cards (cards with the number `1`), all the `b` cards (cards with the number `0`), and some of the `k - a - b` cards from the cards with the number `-1`. So the maximum sum is `a - (k - (a + b))`.
