**FIXES**:
The code seems to have off-by-one errors while handling the array of skewer lengths. It should be fixed by making the following changes:
- The array `a` should be declared with size `110`, not `n`.
- While reading the input, the loop should start from `0` instead of `1`.
- The loop in line 10 should iterate from `n-2` to `1` instead of `n-1` to `0`.

Additionally, the code seems to be using unnecessary functions and includes at the beginning. We should remove the unused header `<bits/stdc++.h>`, and instead include `<cstdio>` for the `scanf` and `printf` functions.
