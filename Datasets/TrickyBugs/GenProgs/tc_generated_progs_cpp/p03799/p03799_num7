**BUG FIXES:**

1. In the code, the variable `n` is used before it is initialized with the value from input. This should be fixed by changing `cin>>a>>n;` to `cin>>n>>a;`

2. The condition `if(a>=n)` checks if the number of `S`-shaped pieces is greater than or equal to the total number of pieces. However, the problem statement states that we can combine two `c`-shaped pieces into one `S`-shaped piece. So, the condition should be `if(a>=2*n)` to check if we have enough `S`-shaped and `c`-shaped pieces to form `Scc` groups.

3. The calculation of the variable `b` is incorrect. The calculation should be `b = (n - (2 * a)) / 2;` instead of `b = (n - (a * 2)) / 4;`

4. The calculation of the variable `cnt` should be `cnt = a + b;`

5. The `return` statement should be replaced with a `cout` statement to print the value of `cnt`.

**CODE:**
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    long long n, a, cnt;
    cin >> n >> a;
    
    if (a >= 2 * n)
        cnt = n;
    else
    {
        long long b = (n - (2 * a)) / 2;
        cnt = a + b;
    }

    cout << cnt << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
