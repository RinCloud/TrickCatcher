**REPAIRED CODE**:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int a = 0;
  int i;
  int sum = 0;
  char s[11];
  
  scanf("%s", s);
  
  for (i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    if (s[i] == 'A' || s[i] == 'T' || s[i] == 'G' || s[i] == 'C') {
      a++;
    } else {
      a = 0;
    }
    if (sum < a) {
      sum = a;
    }
  }
 
  printf("%d\n", sum);
  
  return 0;
}
```

The repaired code includes the following changes:

1. The for loop condition has been changed from `i < 10` to `s[i] != '\0'` to correctly handle strings of different lengths.
2. The else statement has been added to reset the count `a` to 0 when a non-ACGT character is encountered.
3. The if condition inside the for loop has been modified to compare `sum` with `a` and update `sum` if `a` is greater than `sum`.
