There is a bug in the code.

The variable "ans" is not initialized to 0 before performing the calculations. 

The correction can be made by initializing the variable "ans" to 0 before performing the calculations.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  long n,a,b,ans=0;
  cin >> n >> a >> b;
  
  ans+=n/(a+b)*a;
  
  ans+=min(n%(a+b),a);
  cout << ans;
  return 0;
}
```
