**Repaired Code**:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int A,B,C,D;
  cin >> A>>B>>C>>D;

  if ((C+B-1)/B<= (A+D-1)/D){
    cout << "No" << endl;
  }
  else{
    cout << "Yes" << endl;
  }
}
```

**Explanation**:

The original code has a logical error. The condition `(A-C/B*D>0 || C%B==0)` is incorrect.

To determine the winner, we need to check if the number of attacks required by each player is the same. The number of attacks required can be calculated by `(health + damage - 1) / damage`.

So, we can compare the number of attacks required by both players and if the number of attacks required by Aoki OR equal is greater than or equal to the number of attacks required by Takahashi, then Aoki will win. Otherwise, Takahashi will win.
