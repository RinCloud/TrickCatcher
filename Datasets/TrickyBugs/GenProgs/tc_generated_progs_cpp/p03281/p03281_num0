**REPAIRED CODE**:

```cpp
#include"bits/stdc++.h"
using namespace std;

int divisors(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            // If divisors are equal, count only one
            if (n / i == i) {
                count++;
            } else { // Otherwise, count both divisors
                count += 2;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 2) {
        if (divisors(i) == 8) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    cout << count << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
The original code is not correctly solving the problem. It has a hard-coded array of numbers that are odd and have exactly 8 divisors. The code then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to these numbers and increments a counter. However, this approach will not work for large values of `n` and does not guarantee that all odd numbers with 8 divisors will be counted.

The repaired code uses a function `divisors` to calculate the number of divisors for a given number. It then iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the number of divisors is equal to 8. If it is, the counter is incremented.

By using this approach, the code correctly counts the number of odd numbers with exactly 8 positive divisors between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
