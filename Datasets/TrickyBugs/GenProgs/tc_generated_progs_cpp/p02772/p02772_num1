**Repaired Code**:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main(){ 
    int n, s = 0;
    cin >> n; 
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        int a;
        cin >> a;
        if(a % 2 == 0 && (a % 3 != 0 && a % 5 != 0)){
            s++;
        }
    }
    if(s > 0){
        cout << "DENIED" << endl;
    }
    else{
        cout << "APPROVED" << endl;
    }
}
```

Note: The bug in the original code was in the condition for whether the number `a` was divisible by 3 or 5. In the original code, if `a` was not divisible by 3 and 5, `s` was incremented, which is incorrect. The repaired code fixes this by modifying the condition to check if `a` is not divisible by both 3 and 5.
