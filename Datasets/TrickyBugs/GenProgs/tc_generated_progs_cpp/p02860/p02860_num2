**REPAIRED CODE**:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int N;
    string S;
    cin>>N>>S;

    string T = S.substr(0, N/2); // extract the first N/2 characters as T
    if(S == T + T){
        cout<<"Yes"<<endl;
        return 0;
    }
    cout<<"No"<<endl;
}
```

**Explanation**:

In the given code, the logic is flawed. 

The `rfind` function in `S.rfind(S.substr(0, N/2))` returns the starting index of the last occurrence of the substring `S.substr(0, N/2)` in string `S`. However, in order for the string to be a concatenation of two copies of some string, the substring `S.substr(0, N/2)` should occur at the beginning of the string `S`, not at the end.

To fix this, we can extract the first `N/2` characters of `S` as a separate string `T`, and then check if `S` is equal to `T + T`. If they are equal, then `S` is a concatenation of two copies of `T`, otherwise it is not.
