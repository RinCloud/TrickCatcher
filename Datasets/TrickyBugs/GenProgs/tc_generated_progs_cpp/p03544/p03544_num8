**Repaired code**:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

long long l[87];
int n;

int main() {
    l[0] = 2; 
    l[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= 86; i++) {
        l[i] = l[i-1] + l[i-2];
    }

    cin >> n; 
    cout << l[n]; 
    
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation: 
1. The code has a logical error in the declaration of the `l[]` array. It should be declared with size 87 instead of 86 because the range of Lucas numbers given in the problem is from L_0 to L_86.
2. The header `<bits/stdc++.h>` is not standard and not required. It can be replaced with `<iostream>`.
3. We need to include the `return 0;` statement at the end of the `main` function in order to properly terminate the program.
4. Added necessary spaces and indentation to improve code readability.
