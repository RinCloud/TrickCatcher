**CORRECTED CODE**:

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long l[87];
int n;
int main() {
    l[0]=2; l[1]=1;
    for (int i=2; i<=86; i++) l[i]=l[i-1]+l[i-2];
    
    cin >> n; cout << l[n]; 
}
```

Explanation: In the initial code, the array `l` is declared with a size of 86. However, the loop to compute the Lucas numbers runs from `i=2` to `i<=86`, which means it is accessing `l[86]`, leading to a buffer overflow. To fix this, we need to declare the array `l` with a size of 87 to include the index `86`.
