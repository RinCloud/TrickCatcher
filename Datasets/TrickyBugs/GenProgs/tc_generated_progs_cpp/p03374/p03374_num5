** NEW CODE **:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
long long n, c, x[100001], v[100001], s[100001], u[100001];

int main()
{
    long long maxx = 0;
    scanf("%lld %lld", &n, &c);
    for(int i=1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        scanf("%lld %lld", &x[i], &v[i]);
        s[i] = s[i-1] + v[i] - (x[i] - x[i-1]);
    }
    for(int i=n; i>=1; i--)
    {
        u[i] = u[i+1] + v[i] - (c - x[i]);
    }
    for(int i=n; i>=1; i--)
    {
        maxx = max(maxx, u[i]);
        maxx = max(maxx, s[i]);
        maxx = max(maxx, s[i] - u[i+1]);
    }
    printf("%lld", maxx);
    return 0;
}
```
I have modified the code to fix some bugs and make the logic clearer.

1. First, I renamed the variables `m` to `c` to better represent the circumference of the counter.

2. In the first loop, I removed the unnecessary `w` and `rv` arrays because they were not used.

3. I changed the initialization of `maxx` to 0 to avoid undefined behavior.

4. I updated the calculation of `s[i]` to consider the difference in positions between consecutive sushi pieces.

5. I removed the second `for` loop and directly calculated `u[i]` using the difference between the circumference `c` and the sushi position `x[i]`.

6. In the second `for` loop, I added two additional `max` statements to update `maxx`. One to check the maximum value of `u[i]` and another to check the maximum value of `s[i] - u[i+1]`.

7. Finally, I printed `maxx` as the resulting value.
