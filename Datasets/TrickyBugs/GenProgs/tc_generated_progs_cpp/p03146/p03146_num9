**REPAIRED CODE**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  int s;
  cin >> s;
  int cnt = 0;
  while(s != 1){
    cnt++;
    if(s%2 == 0) s /= 2;
    else s = s * 3 + 1;
  }
  cout << cnt << endl;
}
```

EXPLANATION:
- In the original code, there is an incorrect check `if(s == 3) cnt += 5;` which adds 5 to the `cnt` variable if the input `s` is equal to 3. This check is unnecessary and incorrect because it does not follow the given logic of generating the sequence.
- Next, there is a while loop `while(s > 4)` which is used to generate the sequence until `s` becomes 4, after which it breaks out of the loop. However, it is not guaranteed that the sequence will always reach 4 for any given input `s`. Therefore, this check is incorrect and should be removed.
- Lastly, there is a `cout << cnt + 4 << endl;` statement, which adds 4 to the `cnt` variable before printing it. This addition is unnecessary and incorrect because it does not follow the given condition of finding the minimum integer `m` that satisfies the condition `a_m = a_n`. Instead, it should simply print the value of `cnt`.
