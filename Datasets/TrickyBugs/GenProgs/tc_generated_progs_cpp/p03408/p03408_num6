The code has the following bugs/logic flaws:

1. The code does not correctly store the strings of blue cards and red cards in separate arrays. It uses the same "str[]" array to store both blue and red card strings.

2. The code does not handle multiple occurrences of the same string correctly. It does not increment the count of blue cards correctly when there are multiple cards with the same string.

3. The code does not handle the case when a red card string does not match any blue card string correctly. It still subtracts 1 from the count of blue cards.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

map<string, int> m;
vector<string> blue_cards;
vector<string> red_cards;

int main()
{
    int n;
    string s;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> s;
        blue_cards.push_back(s);
        m[s]++;
    }

    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> s;
        red_cards.push_back(s);
        if (m.find(s) != m.end()) {
            m[s]--;
        }
    }

    int ma = 0;
    for (const auto& card : blue_cards) {
        if (m[card] > ma) {
            ma = m[card];
        }
    }

    cout << ma << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
