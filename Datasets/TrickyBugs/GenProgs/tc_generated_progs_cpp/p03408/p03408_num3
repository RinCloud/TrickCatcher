The code has two major issues:

1. The variable "n" is used to represent both the number of blue cards and the number of red cards. This will lead to incorrect counting of blue and red cards. To fix this, we need to define a separate variable to represent the number of red cards.

2. The loop to iterate over the red cards is using the same variable "i" which was used to iterate over the blue cards. This will result in missing some red cards during the counting. We need to use a separate loop variable for the red cards.

Here is the patched code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

map<string, int> m;
string str[120];

int main(){
    int n, m, ma = 0, i;
    string st;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        char s[100];
        scanf("%s", s);
        str[i] = s;
        m[str[i]]++;
    }
    scanf("%d", &m); // Use separate variable for red card count
    for(i = 1; i <= m; i++){ // Use separate variable for red card loop
        char s[100];
        scanf("%s", s);
        st = s;
        m[st]--;
    }
    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        if(m[str[i]] > ma) ma = m[str[i]];
    }
    printf("%d",ma);
}
```
