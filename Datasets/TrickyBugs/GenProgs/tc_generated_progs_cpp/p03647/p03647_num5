**REPAIRED CODE:**

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <algorithm>

int N, M;
int a[200001], b[200001];

bool con_to_N[200001];

void solve() {
    std::fill(con_to_N, con_to_N+N+1, false);
	for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++) {
		con_to_N[a[i]] = (b[i] == N);
	}

	bool possible = false;
	for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++) {
		if (a[i] == 1 && con_to_N[b[i]]) {
			possible = true;
			break;
		}
	}

	printf("%s\n", possible ? "POSSIBLE" : "IMPOSSIBLE");
}

int main() {
	scanf("%d%d", &N, &M);
	for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++) {
		scanf("%d%d", &a[i], &b[i]);
	}

	solve();
	return 0;
}
```

The issue with the original code is that the `con_to_N` array is not properly initialized. The array is used to store whether there is a connection from a particular island to Island N. In the original code, the array is not initialized, so it contains garbage values. This can cause incorrect results.

To fix this issue, I have added `std::fill(con_to_N, con_to_N+N+1, false);` to initialize the `con_to_N` array with false values before using it.

Additionally, I have added the `break` statement in the second loop. This is because once we find a boat service that connects Island 1 to Island N, there is no need to continue checking the remaining services. The `break` statement will exit the loop early in this case.

Now the code should work correctly.
