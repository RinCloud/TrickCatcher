**REPAIRED CODE**:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<long long> v(n);
    for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> v[i];
    }

    long long sum = 0;
    for (long long i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (long long j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            long long product = (v[i] * v[j]) % (1000000007);
            sum += product;
            sum %= 1000000007;
        }
    }

    cout << sum;
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- In the original code, the variable `a` was not initialized before the loop.
- Another issue with the original code was that it was adding `v[j + 1] % 1000000007 * a` to the `sum`, which is incorrect. To find the sum of `A_i * A_j` for all pairs `(i, j)`, we need to sum over all values of `i` and `j` such that `1 <= i < j <= N`.
- The repaired code uses a nested loop to iterate over all pairs `(i, j)`, calculates the product `v[i] * v[j] % 1000000007`, and adds it to the `sum`. The `sum` is then printed as the output.
