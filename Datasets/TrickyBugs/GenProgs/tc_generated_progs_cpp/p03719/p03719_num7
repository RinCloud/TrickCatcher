**REPAIRED CODE**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b, c;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;

    if (c >= a && c <= b) {
        cout << "Yes";
    } else {
        cout << "No";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanations:

- The original code had some incorrect logic. To determine whether `C` is not less than `A` and not greater than `B`, we need to use the comparison operators `>=` and `<=` instead of `>` and `<`.
- The original code also included unnecessary conditions (`c == a` and `c == b`) in the `if` statement.
- The original code used unnecessary headers (`<bits/stdc++.h>`), which are not needed for this problem.
