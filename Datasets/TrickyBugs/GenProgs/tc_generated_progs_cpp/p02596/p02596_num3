**BUGS/LOGIC FLAWS**:
1. The variable `left` is not initialized to 0 before its first use.
2. The loop condition `for(i=1;i<=n;i++)` should be `for(i=1;i<=n;i++)` as the indices of the sequence start from 1.
3. The loop should only run `n` times at most. So, the condition of the loop should be changed to `for(i=1;i<=n;i++)` instead of `for(i=1;i<=n;i++)`.
4. The line `left=(7+left*10)%n;` is causing integer overflow because `left` can become very large when `n` is large. To avoid this, we should be calculating the modulus at every step inside the loop.

**REPAIRED CODE**:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
using namespace std;
signed main() {
	int n;
	cin>>n;
	int i, left = 0;
	for(i=1;i<=n;i++){
		left=(7+left*10)%n;
		if(left==0){
			break;
		}
	}
	if(!left){
		cout<<i;
	}
	else{
		cout<<-1;
	}
	return 0;
}
