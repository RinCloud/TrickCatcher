**REPAIRED CODE**:

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int a, b, c;
int main() {
	cin>>a>>b>>c;
	if(a==b && b==c) {cout<<a%2-1; return 0;}
	int s = 0;
	while(!(a%2 || b%2 || c%2)) {
		int x = (b+c)/2;
		int y = (a+c)/2;
		int z = (a+b)/2;
		a=x, b=y, c=z;
		s++;
		if (a==b && b==c) {
			cout<<-1; return 0;
		}
	}
	cout<<s;
	return 0;
}
```

**CHANGES MADE:**
There are a few mistakes in the code.
1. The variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `s` are not initialized. I have initialized them to 0.
2. In the while loop, the division operation is performed incorrectly. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` should be assigned the half values of `b+c`, `a+c`, and `a+b` respectively. I have corrected the assignment statements.
3. The condition in the if statement after the while loop is incorrect. It should check if `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, not just `a` and `b`. I have corrected the condition.

With these changes, the code should work correctly.
