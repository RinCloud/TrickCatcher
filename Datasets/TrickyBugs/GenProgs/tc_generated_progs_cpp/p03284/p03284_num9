**Repaired code**:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    cout<<min(a%b, b-a%b)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
**Explanation for the repaired code**:

To distribute `N` AtCoder Crackers to `K` users as evenly as possible, we can use the modulo operator `%` to determine the number of crackers that each user can receive.

The expression `a%b` calculates the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. This gives us the number of leftover crackers that cannot be distributed equally among the users.

However, the original code had an additional modulo operation `% 2`. This would give us either 0 or 1, indicating if the remainder is even or odd. But since the task is to find the minimum possible absolute difference between the largest and smallest number of crackers received by a user, we don't need to consider the parity of the remainder.

To find the minimum possible absolute difference, we need to consider two cases:
1. If `a%b` is smaller than `b-a%b`, then it means that there are fewer leftover crackers than the number of crackers that can be added to the users to distribute them evenly. In this case, the minimum possible absolute difference is `a%b`.
2. Otherwise, if `a%b` is greater than or equal to `b-a%b`, then it means that there are more leftover crackers than the number of crackers that can be added to the users to distribute them evenly. In this case, the minimum possible absolute difference is `b-a%b`.

The `min()` function is used to compare the two cases and return the smaller value. This value is then printed as the output.

Thus, the repaired code correctly finds the minimum possible (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user.
