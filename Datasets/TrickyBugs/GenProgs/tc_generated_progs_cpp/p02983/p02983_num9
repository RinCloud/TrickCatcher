**BUG FIXES & CODE REPAIR**:

- In the given code, there is no need to use the `def` variable.
- The calculation of `def` is incorrect, it should be `(r-l)%2019` rather than `(r-l)%2020`.
- The calculation of `r` is incorrect, it should be `r=l+def` % 2019 rather than `r=l+def`.
- The outer loop should start from 0 rather than `l`.
- The inner loop should start from `i+1` rather than `1`.
- After making the above changes, the output should be `ans%2019`, rather than `ans`.

The repairs are as follows:

**REPAIRED CODE**:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  long long l,r,ans=2019;
  cin>>l>>r;
  l %= 2019;
  r %= 2019;
  
  for(long long i=0;i<=r-1;i++){
    for(long long j=i+1;j<=r;j++){
      ans=min(ans,(i*j)%2019);
    }
  }
  cout<<ans%2019;
}
```
