The bug in the code is that the variables 'f' and 's' are being used without initializing them. To fix this, initialize both 'f' and 's' to zero before using them in the for loop.
Also, there is a logic flaw in the code. In the for loop, we are checking if the distance from cell i to cell 1 is less than or equal to the distance from cell i to cell N. However, in the problem statement, Fennec is the first player and Snuke is the second player. So, Fennec should be painting cells adjacent to black cells and Snuke should be painting cells adjacent to white cells. Therefore, the condition in the for loop should be reversed.

Here is the repaired code:

```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int n,m,k=0;
int dist[2][100005];
int vis[100005];
vector<int> v[100005];
inline void dfs(int x,int l,int k)
{
	vis[x]=1;
	dist[l][x]=k;
	for (int i=0;i<v[x].size();i++)
	{
		if (vis[v[x][i]]==0)
			dfs(v[x][i],l,k+1);
	}
}
int main()
{
	scanf("%d",&n);
	for (int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
	{
		int x,y;
		scanf("%d%d",&x,&y);
		x--,y--;
		v[x].push_back(y);
		v[y].push_back(x);
	}
	memset(vis,0,sizeof(vis));
	dfs(0,0,0);
	memset(vis,0,sizeof(vis));
	dfs(n-1,1,0);
	int f = 0, s = 0; // Initialize f and s to zero
	for (int i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		if (dist[0][i]>=dist[1][i]) // Reverse the condition
			f++;
		else
			s++;
	}
	if (f>s)
		printf("Fennec");
	else
		printf("Snuke");
	return 0;
}
```
