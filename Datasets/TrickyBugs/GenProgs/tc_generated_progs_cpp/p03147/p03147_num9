**PROBLEM DESCRIPTION**:
In a flower bed, there are N flowers, numbered 1,2,......,N. Initially, the heights of all flowers are 0. You are given a sequence h=\\{h_1,h_2,h_3,......\\} as input. You would like to change the height of Flower k to h_k for all k (1 \leq k \leq N), by repeating the following "watering" operation:
* Specify integers l and r. Increase the height of Flower x by 1 for all x such that l \leq x \leq r.
Find the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.

CONSTRAINTS:
* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 0 \leq h_i \leq 100
* All values in input are integers.

INPUT:
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
h_1 h_2 h_3 ...... h_N

OUTPUT:
Print the minimum number of watering operations required to satisfy the condition.

EXAMPLES:

INPUT:
4
1 2 2 1

OUTPUT:
2

INPUT:
5
3 1 2 3 1

OUTPUT:
5

INPUT:
8
4 23 75 0 23 96 50 100

OUTPUT:
221

**CODE**:
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  int n,a,ans;
  ans=0;
  cin>>n;
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    int h;
    cin>>h;
    if(h>a){ans+=h-a;}
    a=h;
  }
  cout<<ans;
}
```
