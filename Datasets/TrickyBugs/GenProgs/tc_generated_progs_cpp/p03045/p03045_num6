**SOLUTION**

This code implements a disjoint set data structure to determine the connected components in a graph. The logic is mostly correct, but there is one bug and one improvement that can be made.

Bug:
The bug is in line 35 of the code. The code should output `n - t + 1` instead of `n - t`. This is because the connected components found by the disjoint set data structure represent independent sets of cards. If we know the value of one card in a connected component, we can determine the values of all other cards in the same connected component. Therefore, we need to add one to the answer for each connected component.

Improvement:
Currently, the code initializes the disjoint set data structure with each card as its own parent (i.e., `f[i] = i`). However, it would be more efficient to initialize the disjoint set data structure with higher rank values (e.g., `f[i] = i` and `rank[i] = 1`). This would improve the efficiency of the `bb` function.

Here is the complete code with the bug fixed and improvement applied:
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n, m;
int f[100001];
int rank[100001];

int bb(int p) {
    if (f[p] == p) return p;
    return f[p] = bb(f[p]);
}

int main() {
    cin >> n >> m;
    int i, x, y, z, t = m;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        f[i] = i;
        rank[i] = 1;
    }
    for (i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        cin >> x >> y >> z;
        if (bb(x) == bb(y)) {
            t--;
        } else {
            if (rank[bb(x)] < rank[bb(y)]) swap(x, y);
            f[bb(y)] = bb(x);
            if (rank[bb(x)] == rank[bb(y)]) rank[bb(x)]++;
        }
    }
    cout << n - t + 1;
    return 0;
}
```
