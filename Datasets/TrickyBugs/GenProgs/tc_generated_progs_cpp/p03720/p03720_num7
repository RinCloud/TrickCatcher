**Repaired Code**:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    vector<int> r(n, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        r[a-1]++;
        r[b-1]++;
    }

    for (int c : r) {
        cout << c << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The repaired code fixes the following issues:
- The loop in line 7 should iterate `m` times, so the condition should be `i < m` instead of `i < m*2`.
- In the loop in line 8, the code should read the values of `a` and `b` as two separate integers, instead of reading a single integer `t`. Then, it should increment `r[a-1]` and `r[b-1]` to count the number of roads connected to each city.
- In line 13, we need to add a `return 0;` statement to indicate a successful termination of the program.
