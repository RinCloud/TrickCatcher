The code provided seems to have a bug in the main logic of the program. The variable d is supposed to represent the current position of Aoki in the grid, but it is not updated correctly in the while loop. The condition "while (d < y)" does not accurately reflect Aoki's position in the grid. 
To fix this, we need to replace the condition "while (d < y)" with "while (d < x)" because Aoki's position should be less than or equal to x, not y.
