Here is the complete repaired code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_N = 50;
const int MAX_X = 50;
const int MAX_SUM = 50 * MAX_N;

int n, a;
long long ans, dp[MAX_N + 1][MAX_SUM + 1];
int x[MAX_N];

int main() {
    cin >> n >> a;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> x[i];
    }

    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            for (int k = MAX_SUM; k >= x[i]; k--) {
                dp[j + 1][k] += dp[j][k - x[i]];
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < MAX_SUM + 1; j++) {
            if (j * i == a * n) {
                ans += dp[i][j];
            }
        }
    }

    cout << ans << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The repaired code fixes the following issues:
1. The array `w` was mistakenly declared with size `5000` for the first dimension, which should be `MAX_SUM + 1` as defined in the problem constraints.
2. The loop condition of the inner `j` loop inside the second `for` loop was incorrect, which should be `j >= 1` instead of `j >= 100`.
3. The first `for` loop was not necessary, as it updated `ans` inside the loop which would cause double-counting.
4. The repaired code introduces a new 2D array `dp` to store the number of ways at each sum and each count. The array `dp[j][k]` represents the number of ways to select `j` cards such that their sum is `k`. This allows for a more efficient computation of the number of ways to select cards that sum up to `A`.
