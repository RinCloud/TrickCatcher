**REPAIRED CODE**:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int n, max=0;
    cin>>n;
    vector<int> a(n);
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        cin>>a[i];
        if(a[i] > max) max = a[i];
    }
    
    int count = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        if(a[i] == max) count++;
    }
    
    cout<<count<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The original code had several bugs and logic flaws:
1. The array `a` was declared with a fixed size of 1,000,000 which is unnecessary and can lead to memory allocation errors. I replaced it with a `vector<int>` of size `n` to store the input sequence.
2. The code incorrectly incremented `a[b]`, `a[b+1]`, and `a[b-1]` for each element in the input sequence, regardless of whether those values were valid indices. 
3. The code incorrectly checked if `a[b]`, `a[b+1]`, or `a[b-1]` were greater than the current maximum, and updated the maximum accordingly. But it failed to consider that `b` can be equal to 0, which would cause an out-of-bounds access when accessing `a[b-1]`. 
4. The code counted the number of `i` such that `a_i = X` by iterating over all elements of the input and comparing them with `max`. This is incorrect because `max` may not be equal to `X`.
5. The code did not accurately count the maximum number of occurrences of any element in the input sequence. I added a `count` variable to count the occurrences of `max` in the input sequence, and printed that count as the result.
