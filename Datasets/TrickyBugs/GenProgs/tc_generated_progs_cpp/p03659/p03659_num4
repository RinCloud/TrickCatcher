**Analysis:**
There are a few bugs and logic flaws in the given code:
1. The variable `S` is not initialized before using it in line 12 to calculate `S+=x[i]`.
2. The vector `x` is declared with a fixed size of 200000, which may be larger than the given value of `n` and cause an out-of-range error in line 17 when reading `x[i]`.
3. The loop in line 16 should iterate until `i<n` instead of `i<n-1` to consider all the cards.
4. The code in line 16 calculates the absolute difference using `abs(S-=2*x[i])`, which subtracts twice the current element from `S`. However, this is incorrect because `S` should only be updated by subtracting the current element. The correct calculation should be `abs(S-2*x[i])`.

**Repaired Code:**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define rep(i,b) for(ll i=0;i<b;i++)

int main() {
    ll S = 0, n, Min = INT_MAX;
    cin >> n;
    vector<ll> x(n);
    rep(i, n) {
        cin >> x[i];
        S += x[i];
    }
    rep(i, n) {
        Min = min(Min, abs(S - 2 * x[i]));
    }
    cout << Min << endl;
}
```
