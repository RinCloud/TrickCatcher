**FIXED CODE**:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int a,b;
string s1,s2,s3; 
int main() {
	cin>>s1>>s2;
	cin>>a>>b;
	cin>>s3;
	if(s1 == s3) 
	  a--;
	else 
	  b--;
	cout<<a<<" "<<b;
	return 0;
}
```
**Explanation:**

There is only one issue with the given code. In the if condition, the code is comparing the first characters of strings `s1` and `s3` instead of comparing the entire strings. Hence the condition always fails, and `b` is decremented.
Therefore, we only need to modify the if condition to `s1 == s3` for it to work correctly.
