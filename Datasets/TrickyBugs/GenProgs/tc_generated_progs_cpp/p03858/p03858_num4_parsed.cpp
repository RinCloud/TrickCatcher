**COMMENTS**:

The code seems to solve the problem correctly. However, it has several issues:

1. The code is missing necessary header files for the standard input/output operations.
2. The code does not use `std` namespace for standard library functions and data types, resulting in a lot of repetition of `std::`.
3. The code uses a fixed size array `ps[]` to store pinholes, which can cause an out-of-bounds error if the number of pinholes exceeds the array size.
4. The code uses global variables and functions, creating potential naming conflicts and poor modularity.
5. The code initializes the counter `res` as `ll` (long long integer), but divides it by 2 at the end when printing the result. This division may cause truncation of the result if it is an odd number.

I will fix these issues and provide a repaired version of the code.
