**UPDATED CODE**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int n, m, ans;
vector<int> s;
vector<vector<int>> a;

void dfs(int p, int parent) {
    s[p] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (a[p][i] && i != parent) {
            if (s[i] == 0) {
                dfs(i, p);
            }
            else if (s[i] == 1) {
                ans++;
                a[p][i] = a[i][p] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
    s[p] = 2;
}

int main()
{
    cin >> n >> m;
    a = vector<vector<int>>(n+1, vector<int>(n+1));
    s = vector<int>(n+1);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int t1, t2;
        scanf("%d %d", &t1, &t2);
        a[t1][t2] = a[t2][t1] = 1;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (s[i] == 0) {
            dfs(i, 0);
        }
    }
    cout << ans;
    return 0;
}

Explanation:
- The original code had a recursive function named `f` to perform DFS traversal starting from a given vertex. But the implementation of this function was incorrect and didn't handle the case where an edge is a bridge correctly.
- I changed the function name from `f` to `dfs` to make it more clear and understandable.
- I replaced the `s` array with a vector named `s` to store the state of each vertex during the traversal. Initially, all states are set to 0. During the traversal, if a vertex is being visited (`s[i] = 1`), it means that it is part of an active path. If a vertex has been visited and all its neighbors have been visited (`s[i] = 2`), it means that it is not part of any active path anymore.
- I replaced the 2D array `a` with a vector of vectors named `a` to represent the adjacency matrix of the graph. This allows us to easily access the neighbors of each vertex.
- In the `dfs` function, I added an additional parameter `parent` to keep track of the parent vertex during the traversal. This is necessary to correctly identify bridges in the graph.
- Inside the `dfs` function, I replaced the `for` loop that checks if an edge is a bridge with a condition that checks if the neighboring vertex is the parent vertex. If it is, we skip that edge as it is not possible to be a bridge. This avoids counting non-bridges as bridges.
- After performing the DFS traversal on each vertex, I print the number of bridges (`ans`) as the output.
