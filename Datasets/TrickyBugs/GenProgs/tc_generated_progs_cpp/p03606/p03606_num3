**REPAIRED CODE**:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int n,l,r,m = 0; // initialize m to 0
    cin>>n;
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
    	cin>>l>>r;
    	m += r - l + 1;
	}
	cout<<m<<endl;
	return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- The main issue in the code is that the variable `m` is not initialized. Therefore, we need to initialize it to 0 before using it.
- Additionally, the code missing an indentation, which makes it harder to read. 
- After applying these fixes, the code should work correctly.
