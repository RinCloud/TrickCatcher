**Repaired Code**:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int n, l, r, m = 0;
    cin >> n;
    for(int i=1; i <= n; i++){
    	cin >> l >> r;
        m += r - l + 1;
	}
	cout << m << endl;
	return 0;
}
```
Explanation: 

The code had a bug in the initialization of the variable `m`, which is used to count the number of people sitting at the theater. It should have been initialized to `0` before the for loop.
