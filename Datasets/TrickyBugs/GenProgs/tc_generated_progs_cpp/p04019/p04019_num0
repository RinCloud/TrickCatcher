**REPAIRED CODE**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string S;
    cin >> S;

    int N = S.size();

    unordered_map<char, bool> E;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        E[S[i]] = true;
    }

    bool NS = E.count('N') && E.count('S');
    bool WE = E.count('W') && E.count('E');

    cout << (NS && WE ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:

1. Changed `E[1 << 8]` to `unordered_map<char, bool> E` because the original code tries to map each character in `S` to a boolean value indicating its presence. Using an `unordered_map` is a more appropriate data structure for this task.
2. Created two Boolean variables `NS` and `WE` to separately check whether both `N` and `S` are present, and whether both `W` and `E` are present in the map `E`.
3. Updated the output condition to `(NS && WE)` instead of using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) as in the original code. This ensures that both `N` and `S` are present, and both `W` and `E` are present, which is the required condition for him to be back at home.
