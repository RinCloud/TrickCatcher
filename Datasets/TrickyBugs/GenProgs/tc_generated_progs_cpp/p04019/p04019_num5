The given code has a bug in the definition of the boolean array E. The array is defined with a size of "1 << 8", which means it has 2^8 = 256 elements. However, the code uses the characters in string S as indices for the array, which can have values greater than 256. This will lead to an out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior.

To fix this, the array E should be defined with a size of 256:
```cpp
bool E[256];
```

Additionally, the logical expression for determining whether it is possible to return home is incorrect. The condition should be that there are an equal number of 'N' and 'S' characters in S, and an equal number of 'W' and 'E' characters in S. 

Therefore, the corrected code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string S;
    cin >> S;

    int N = S.size();

    bool E[256];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        E[S[i]] = true;
    }

    int cntNS = abs(count(S.begin(), S.end(), 'N') - count(S.begin(), S.end(), 'S'));
    int cntWE = abs(count(S.begin(), S.end(), 'W') - count(S.begin(), S.end(), 'E'));

    cout << (cntNS == 0 && cntWE == 0 ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
