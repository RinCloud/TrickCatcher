The code is almost correct. The only issue is that the variable `z` is not initialized before using it to track the number of bricks that need to be broken. To fix this, we need to initialize `z` to 0 before the loop.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,z=0,s=1;
    cin>>a;
    int q[a];
    for(int i=0;i<a;i++) cin>>q[i];
    for(int i=0;i<a;i++)
    {
        if(q[i]==s){
            z++;
            s++;
        }
    }
    if(z==0) cout<<"-1";
    else cout<<a-z;
}
```
