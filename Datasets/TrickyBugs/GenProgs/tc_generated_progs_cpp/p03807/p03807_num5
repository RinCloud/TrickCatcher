The code has two issues:
1. The variable `Xor` is not initialized before being used in the XOR operation. It should be initialized to 0.
2. The XOR operation is being performed on the parity of the numbers, but the problem requires the XOR operation to be performed on the numbers themselves.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, Xor = 0, A;
    scanf("%d", &N);
    while(N--) {
        scanf("%d", &A);
        Xor ^= A;
    }
    puts(Xor ? "NO" : "YES");
    return 0;
}
```
