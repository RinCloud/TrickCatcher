**APPROACH**

The given code attempts to solve the problem using xor operation. The xor operation of two numbers will be 1 if the numbers have different parities (one number is even and the other is odd), and 0 if the numbers have the same parity (both numbers are even or both numbers are odd).

The code iterates through the given integers and performs the xor operation between the previous xor result and the parity of the current number. Finally, it checks if the xor result is 0 or not and prints the corresponding output.

The approach used by the code is correct, but there are a few bugs in the code:

1. The variable `Xor` is not initialized, which will result in undefined behavior.
2. The bitwise xor operation should be performed using the `^` operator, not the `^=` operator.

To fix these bugs, the code can be repaired as follows:
