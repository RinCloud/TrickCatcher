**COMMENTS**:
The code is using `scanf` to read the characters `a` and `b` from input, and then using `puts` function to print the result. The code looks generally correct, but there is a bug in the code that the program reads only a single character instead of a string containing a single character.

**BUG FIX CODE**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() {
    std::string a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    std::cout << (a == b ? "H" : "D") << std::endl;
}
```
