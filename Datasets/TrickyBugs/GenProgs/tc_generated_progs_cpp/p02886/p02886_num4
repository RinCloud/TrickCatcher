**Repaired code:**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int N;
  cin >> N;
  int a,b,s=0;
  cin >> b;
  for ( int i=0; i<N-1; ++i) {
    cin >> a;
    s += a*b;
    b +=a;
  }
 
  cout << s;
}
```

Explanation:
1. Initialized `s` variable to 0 because it is used as a counter for sum of health points.
2. Removed `c` variable because it was not used in the code.
3. Added `s=0;` in the beginning because `s` was used without initialization, which is causing unexpected behavior.
