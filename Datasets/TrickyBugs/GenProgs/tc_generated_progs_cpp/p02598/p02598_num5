**UPDATED CODE**:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

signed main() {
    int n, k; cin>>n>>k;
    int a[n]; for(auto &i : a)  cin>>i;
    int lo = 0, hi = 1e9 +1, mid;
    
    while(hi-lo > 1) {
        int cnt = 0;
        mid = (lo+hi)>>1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)  cnt += (a[i] + mid - 1)/mid - 1;
        if(cnt<=k)  hi = mid;
        else    lo = mid;
    }
    cout<<hi;
}
```

**Explanation:**
In the original code, the line `if(a[i] > mid)  cnt += a[i]/mid;` counts the number of cuts required for the `i`-th log. However, this is incorrect. We need to consider the ceiling value when dividing the log length by `mid` to get the number of cuts required. The reason for this is that if there is a remainder, we need to make one more cut. For example, if `a[i] = 9` and `mid = 4`, without using the ceiling value, the code would calculate `9/4 = 2` cuts. But in reality, it would require 3 cuts (`4 + 4 + 1 = 9`). Therefore, the correct calculation is `(a[i] + mid - 1)/mid - 1` to account for the possibility of a remainder.

This updated code now correctly calculates the number of cuts required for each log and finds the shortest possible length of the longest log after at most K cuts.
