**Repaired Code**:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

signed main() {
    int n, k; cin>>n>>k;
    int a[n]; for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin>>a[i];
    int lo = 0, hi = *max_element(a, a+n)+1, mid;
    
    while(hi-lo > 1) {
        int cnt = 0;
        mid = (lo+hi)>>1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            cnt += (a[i] + (mid-1)) / mid - 1;
        if(cnt<=k)  hi = mid;
        else    lo = mid;
    }
    cout<<hi;
}
```

**Problem Explanation:**
- The code aims to find the shortest possible length of the longest log after at most K cuts.
- It uses binary search to find the desired answer. However, there is a bug in the code that needs to be fixed to obtain the correct result.

**Code Fix:**
- In line 9, initialize 'hi' as the maximum element of the array 'a' plus one instead of 1e9 + 1.
- In line 15, update the for loop to calculate 'cnt' correctly using the formula: cnt += (a[i] + (mid-1)) / mid - 1.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- The time complexity of the code is O(N * log(1e9 + MAX_VALUE)) where N is the number of logs and MAX_VALUE is the maximum length of a log.
