**Repaired code:**

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long

signed main() {
    int n, k; cin>>n>>k;
    int a[n]; for(auto &i : a)  cin>>i;
    int lo = 0, hi = 1e9 +1, mid;
    
    while(hi-lo > 1) {
        int cnt = 0;
        mid = (lo+hi)>>1;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)  cnt += (a[i]+mid-1)/mid;
        if(cnt<=k+1)  hi = mid;
        else    lo = mid;
    }
    cout<<hi;
}
```

**Explanation:**

In the original code, the condition for `if(cnt<=k)` is incorrect because it should be `if(cnt<=k+1)` instead.

In the problem, we are allowed to make at most K cuts. However, the original condition `if(cnt<=k)` only checks if we can make exactly K cuts, which is incorrect. We need to check if we can make at most K cuts.

To fix this, I modified the condition to `if(cnt<=k+1)`, which ensures that we can make at most K cuts.
