The code has two bugs:

1. The variable `f` is not initialized to 0.
2. The variable `f` is declared as an integer. Although it will work for most cases, if the number `N` has a large sum of digits, the integer `f` might overflow.

Here is the repaired code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int N, x, f = 0;
    cin >> N;
    for (x = N; x > 0; x = x / 10) {
        f += x % 10;
    }
    if (N % f == 0)
        cout << "Yes" << endl;
    else
        cout << "No" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
