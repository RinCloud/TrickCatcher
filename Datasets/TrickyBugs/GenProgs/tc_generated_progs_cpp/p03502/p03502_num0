**REPAIRED CODE**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  int N,x,f=0;
  cin >> N;
  for(x=N;x>0;x=x/10){
    f+=x%10;
  }
  if(N%f==0)cout << "Yes" << endl;
  else cout << "No" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Explanation: 
The bug in the original code was that the variable `f` was not initialized to 0. This caused the sum of digits calculation to be incorrect. 
Additionally, the original code did not have a space between `endl` and `return 0` which is incorrect formatting. So, I added a space between them for correct formatting.
