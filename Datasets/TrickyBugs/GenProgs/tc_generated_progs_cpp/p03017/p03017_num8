**REPAIRED CODE**:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define mod 1000000007
using ll = long long;

int main() {
    int N, A, B, C, D;
    string S;
    cin >> N >> A >> B >> C >> D;
    cin >> S;
    bool flag = false;
    for (int i = A - 1; i < max(C, D) - 1; ++i) {
        if(S[i] == '#' && S[i+1] == '#') flag = true;
    }
    if(C > D){
        for (int i = B - 2; i <= D - 2; ++i) {
            if(S[i] == '.' && S[i+1] == '.' && S[i+2] == '.') flag = false;
        }
    }
    if(flag){
        cout << "No";
    }else{
        cout << "Yes";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The first issue with the code is the `flag` variable definition. It should be of type bool instead of int, as the intention is to use it as a boolean value.
- The second issue is with the `for` loop that checks for the presence of rocks (`#`) in squares between `A` and `max(C, D) - 1`. The loop should start from `A - 1` instead, because arrays/string indexing is 0-based. So the loop should run for indices `A - 1` to `max(C, D) - 2` (inclusive).
- The third issue is with the condition that checks whether `flag` should be set to 0 or 1. It should be set to `true` (1) if there are rocks (`#`) in squares between `A` and `max(C, D) - 1`, not the other way round.
- Finally, the condition inside the second `for` loop should not set `flag` to 1 initially, as it is already set to 1 based on the previous check. Also, the condition should check if `flag` is `false` (0), not `true` (1), because if any empty squares (`.`) are encountered, `flag` should be set to `false`.

The repaired code addresses these issues.
