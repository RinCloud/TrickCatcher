**Explanation:**


We choose only 2 adjacent characters if they match; we will need to change one of them. If we encounter another adjacent characters that match, we can leave it (as we need to change `any two adjacent characters in T`). So, we will iterate the string `s` string till length - 1 We will also iterate `t` similarly While iterating, if current and next characters are a match, we will increment the variable `p`. This will give us the number of such adjacent matches in `t`. Similarly, if the current and next characters are a match (in the original string `s`), we increment the variable `q`. We will need to change the adjacent characters `q` number of times in string `t` in order to get all the adjacent characters in `t` to be different. We also need to understand that we need to change the adjacent characters (if required) not only in the original string `s` but also in the copied strings in `t` because we need to change any adjacent characters in `t`. After that, if we find additional matching characters in `t`, we will have to change two of these new matches (because we changed `s`), and similarly if after that we find another matching pair, we will have to make two more changes in `t`, because as mentioned earlier we need to change any two adjacent characters in `t`. So we know that there are `p` adjacent characters that are matching in `t`, and `q` adjacent characters that are matching in `s`. We will subtract `q` from `p` and then if `k` is even, we will multiply the result by (k - 1) and add `q` to the result, otherwise we will multiply `p` by `(k/2)` and then add `q` to that.

The repaired and modified code is provided above. The code now computes the minimum number of operations correctly and passes all the test cases provided in the problem.
