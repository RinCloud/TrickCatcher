**CORRECTED CODE**:

```python
#include <stdio.h>
int main (){
    int c;
    scanf ("%d", &c);
    if (c >= 30 && c <= 40) {
        printf ("Yes");
    } else {
        printf ("No");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
The original code is using the ternary operator `? :` to check the condition `c >= 30 && c <= 40`. However, the outcome of the ternary operator is not being used in any way. So we need to change it to `if ... else` statement to correctly handle the condition and print the output accordingly.
