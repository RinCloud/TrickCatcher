**Repaired code**:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int c;
    scanf("%d", &c);
    if (c >= 30)
        printf("Yes");
    else
        printf("No");
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation: 
- The original code uses a ternary operator to print "Yes" or "No" based on the condition `c >= 30 && c <= 40`. However, the problem statement specifies that the air conditioner should be turned on if the temperature is **30 degrees Celsius or above**, which means the condition should be `c >= 30` without the upper limit of 40.
- The repaired code uses an if-else statement to correctly check if the temperature is greater than or equal to 30 and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.
