To find the smallest possible value of X-Y, we need to optimize the process of choosing the contiguous subsequence and removing the smallest element among the K elements in that subsequence.

Here is the repaired code:

```python
N,K,Q = map(int,input().split())
A = list(map(int,input().split()))
B = sorted(A) # A をソート
L = [[i,B[i+K-1] - B[i]] for i in range(N-K+1)] # BからX-Yの最小パターンを出す
sL = sorted(L,key=lambda x:x[1]) # Lをソート

if Q == 1:
    # 一つしか選ばない -> max == min -> 0
    print(0)
    exit()

if Q == N - K + 1:
    # 全部の要素が選ばれる = 必ず最小値が選ばれる
    print(L[0][1])
    exit()

if K == 1:
    # 一つずつ選べる -> 必ず最小のパターンに出来る
    print(sL[0][1])
    exit()

if sL[0][0] == 0:
    # minが最小の時 最小のパターンになる時
    print(sL[0][1])
    exit()

if sL[0][1] == sL[len(sL)-1][1]:
    print(sL[0][1])
    exit()

for key,value in sL:
    max_value = B[key + K - 1]
    min_value = B[key]
    C = [(i if (i >= max_value or i == min_value) else None) for i in A]
    i = 0
    j = 0
    count = 0
    min_OK = max_OK = False
    while i < N:
        if not C[i]:
            i += 1
            continue
        j = i + 1
        while j < N:
            if not C[j]:
                break
            j += 1
        tmp = (j-i) - K + 1
        if  tmp < 1:
            # 要素を取得できないパターン
            i = j + 1
            continue
        sC = sorted(C[i:j])
        if not min_OK and (sC[0] == min_value):
            min_OK = True
        if not max_OK and max_value in sC[0:tmp]:
            max_OK = True
        count += tmp - len([i for i in sC[:tmp] if (i > max_value or i == min_value)])
        i = j +1
    if min_OK and max_OK and (count >= Q):
        print(value)
        exit()

print(L[0][1])
```

The main issue in the original code was that the calculation for finding the largest and smallest values removed was incorrect. The code was using `i + Q - 1` instead of `i + K - 1`. This caused the calculated values to be incorrect and resulted in incorrect comparisons and conditions further down in the code.

I have fixed this issue by changing `B[i+Q-1]` to `B[i+K-1]` in the line `L = [[i,B[i+K-1] - B[i]] for i in range(N-K+1)]`.

Additionally, there was an issue in the subsequence selection process. The code was not properly checking if the smallest and largest values were included in the selected subsequence. To fix this, I have modified the list `C` to include the elements that are either larger than or equal to the `max_value` or equal to the `min_value`. This ensures that the smallest and largest values are included in the subsequence.

With these changes, the code should now correctly find the smallest possible value of X-Y for the given problem.
