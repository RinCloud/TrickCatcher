The given code has a logic flaw. 

The formula used to calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number is incorrect.

The correct formula to calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number is:
`number of ways = (number of even numbers)*(number of odd numbers)`

The number of even numbers between 1 and `K` (inclusive) can be calculated as `K // 2`.

The number of odd numbers between 1 and `K` (inclusive) can be calculated as `(K + 1) // 2`.

The corrected code is as follows:

```
K = int(input())
even_numbers = K // 2
odd_numbers = (K + 1) // 2
number_of_ways = even_numbers * odd_numbers
print(number_of_ways)
```
