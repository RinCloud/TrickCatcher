The given code has a bug in the calculation of the number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number.

The correct formula to calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of an even number and an odd number is n_even * n_odd, where n_even is the number of even numbers between 1 and K (inclusive), and n_odd is the number of odd numbers between 1 and K (inclusive).

To calculate n_even, we can use the formula (K // 2), and to calculate n_odd, we can use the formula (K + 1) // 2.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
K = int(input())
n_even = K // 2
n_odd = (K + 1) // 2
result = n_even * n_odd
print(result)
```
