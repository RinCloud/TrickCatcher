The given code has incorrect logic for determining whether it is possible to buy cakes and doughnuts for the given amount of money.

Here is the repaired code:

```python
n = int(input())

if n % 4 == 0 or n % 7 == 0 or n % 11 == 0:
    print("Yes")
elif n >= 14 and (n - 14) % 4 == 0:
    print("Yes")
elif n >= 21 and (n - 21) % 7 == 0:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

This code checks if the given number is divisible by 4, 7, or 11. If not, it checks if the number can be formed by subtracting 14 or 21 from the given number, followed by multiples of 4 or 7 respectively.
