The given code does not correctly solve the problem. It only considers the case when the largest dimension is odd, but ignores the cases when it is even. Additionally, the code does not calculate the minimum possible difference between the number of red and blue blocks.

Here is the repaired code:

```python
A, B, C = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the six possible differences
diff1 = abs(A * B - C)
diff2 = abs(A * C - B)
diff3 = abs(B * C - A)

# Print the minimum difference
print(min(diff1, diff2, diff3))
```

Now the code calculates all possible differences and selects the minimum difference as the answer.
