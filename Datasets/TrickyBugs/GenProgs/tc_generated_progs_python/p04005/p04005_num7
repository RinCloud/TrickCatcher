My apologies for the mistakenly submitted code. Here is the correct code:

```
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
l.sort()
if l[2] % 2 != 0:
    print(l[0]*l[1])
else:
    print(0)
```

Explanation:
We first take the inputs for A, B, and C. We sort the list `l` in ascending order.
If the greatest element in the list `l` is odd, then we print the product of the first two elements in the list (l[0]*l[1]).
If the greatest element in the list `l` is even, then we print 0.
This code correctly checks for the conditions mentioned in the problem description and calculates the minimum possible difference between the number of red blocks and the number of blue blocks.
