```python
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
l.sort()
if l[2] % 2 != 0:
    print(l[0] * l[1])
else:
    print(0)
```
The initial code implementation has a logical error. It incorrectly calculates the minimum possible difference between the number of red blocks and the number of blue blocks.

To find the minimum possible difference, we need to consider all possible cases:
1. The number of red blocks is equal to the number of blue blocks. In this case, the difference is 0.
2. The number of red blocks is less than the number of blue blocks. In this case, we can make the difference equal to the number of red blocks by painting all red blocks and leaving the remaining blue blocks unpainted.
3. The number of red blocks is greater than the number of blue blocks. In this case, we can make the difference equal to the number of blue blocks by painting all blue blocks and leaving the remaining red blocks unpainted.

To fix the code, we need to modify the logic as follows:

1. Calculate the minimum possible difference as the absolute difference between the product of the two smaller sides and the product of the largest side and the product of the smallest side, i.e., `abs(l[0] * l[1] - l[1] * l[2])`.
2. Print the minimum possible difference.

Here's the repaired code:

```python
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
l.sort()
diff = abs(l[0] * l[1] - l[1] * l[2])
print(diff)
```
