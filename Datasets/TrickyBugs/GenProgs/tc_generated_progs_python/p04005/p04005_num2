**REPAIRED CODE**:

```python
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
l.sort()
if l[2] % 2 != 0:
    print(l[0] * l[1])
else:
    print(0)
```

Explanation:
The code seems to be correct and there is no need for any modification. It takes the input values, sorts them, and then calculates the minimum difference between the number of red blocks and the number of blue blocks based on the given conditions.
