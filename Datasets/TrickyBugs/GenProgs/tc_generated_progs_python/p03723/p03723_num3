The given code has some issues. Firstly, it is using the bitwise or operator (`|`) instead of the logical or operator (`or`) to calculate `e`. Additionally, the second line which calculates the value of `e` is not doing the desired task as mentioned in the problem description. 

Moreover, the code is not calculating the number of times the action will be performed correctly. 

I will provide the repaired code below:

```python
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

count = 0

while a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and c % 2 == 0:
    temp_a = a
    temp_b = b
    temp_c = c

    a = (temp_b + temp_c) // 2
    b = (temp_a + temp_c) // 2
    c = (temp_a + temp_b) // 2

    count += 1

if a % 2 == 1 or b % 2 == 1 or c % 2 == 1:
    print(count)
else:
    print(-1)
```

The above code uses a while loop to iterate until there is a person with an odd number of cookies. It updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` according to the given conditions in the problem description and increments the `count` variable each time the action is performed.

Finally, it checks if there is a remaining person with an odd number of cookies and prints the `count` or -1 accordingly.
