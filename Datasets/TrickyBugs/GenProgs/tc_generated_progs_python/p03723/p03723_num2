Here is the repaired code:

```python
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
e = (a - b) | (b - c)
if e == 0:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(len(bin(e & -e)) - 3)
```

The issue with the original code is that the bitwise OR operator `|` should be replaced with the subtraction operator `-` in the calculation of `e`. Additionally, the condition `e == b & 1` should be replaced with `e == 0` in the `print` statement to correctly handle the case where the answer is infinite.
