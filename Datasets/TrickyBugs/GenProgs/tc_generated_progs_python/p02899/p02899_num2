**Repaired Code:**
```python
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

order = [0] * N
for i, a in enumerate(A):
    order[a - 1] = i + 1

print(' '.join(map(str, order)))
```
**Explanation:**
- First, we input N, the number of students.
- Then we input the list A containing the number of students in the classroom when each student entered.
- We initialize a list `order` of size N to store the order in which students entered.
- For each student number i and the corresponding count a, we set `order[a - 1]` to i + 1. This means that student i entered the classroom at position a.
- Finally, we print `order` as the output, after converting each element to a string and joining them with a space.
