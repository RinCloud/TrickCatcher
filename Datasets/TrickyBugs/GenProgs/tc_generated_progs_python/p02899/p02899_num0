I have found some issues in the code which I have fixed. Please find the repaired code below.

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = [0] * n
for i in range(n):
  result[a[i]-1] = i+1
print(' '.join(str(x) for x in result))
```

Please note that the original code was a one-liner, which is not recommended for readability and maintainability. I have rewritten it in a more readable and understandable way.
