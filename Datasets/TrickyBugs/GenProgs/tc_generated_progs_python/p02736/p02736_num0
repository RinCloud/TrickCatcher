The initial implementation has a few bugs and one logic flaw. Here is the repaired code:

```python
N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, list(input())))

while N != 0:
    digit = 1
    while digit < N:
        digit *= 2

    x = []
    for i in range(digit, N):
        x.append(abs(a[i - digit] - a[i]))

    a = x
    N = digit // 2
    if len(x) == 1:
        break

print(a[0])
```

Explanation of changes:
1. The condition `digit < N // 2` in the inner while loop has been changed to `digit < N`, since `digit` needs to be able to reach the value of `N` itself.
2. The line `N -= digit` has been changed to `N = digit // 2` because the maximum value of `digit` should be reduced by half in every iteration.
3. The repaired code now prints `a[0]` instead of `a[digit - 1]` because the array `a` is updated to `x` in each iteration, and `a[digit - 1]` may not exist anymore.
