```python
import sys

N = int(input())
a = list(map(int, list(input())))
 
while N != 0:
	digit = 1
	while digit < N // 2:
		digit *= 2
 
	x = []
	for i in range(digit, N):
		x.append(abs(a[i - digit] - a[i]))
 
	a = x
	N -= digit
	if len(x) == 1:
		break
 
print(a[0])
```

This code seems to be correct. It takes an input `N` and a sequence of digits `a`. It then iteratively calculates the values of `x` according to the given formula until `N` becomes 0. Finally, it prints the first element of the resulting `a` array.

There doesn't appear to be any bug or logic flaw in the code.
