The code seems to have multiple bugs and logic flaws. I will list them out and provide the corrected code:

1. The code is missing the formula to calculate the number of sequences. The correct formula is `(n//i)**(k-1) - (n//(i+1))**(k-1)` for each `i` in the range `1` to `n` (inclusive). We need to sum up these values for every `i` and take the result modulo `10**9+7`.
2. The code initializes `cnt` as an empty list, but later tries to access elements of `cnt` using the index `[-1]`. We need to initialize `cnt` with a single element `0` at the start.
3. The code calculates the values of `t`, `t_cnt`, and `cnt` multiple times using different variables. We can simplify the code by calculating these values in a single loop.
4. The code initializes `dp` with incorrect dimensions. It should be `[cnt] + [[0]*kind for i in range(k-1)]`.
5. The inner loop that calculates `dp[i][j]` should start from `j=1` instead of `j=0`.
6. The final result should be `dp[-1][kind-1]`, instead of `dp[-1][-1]`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def main():
    MOD=10**9+7
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    cnt = [0]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        cnt.append(cnt[-1] + (n//i)**(k-1) - (n//(i+1))**(k-1))
    
    kind = len(cnt)
    dp = [cnt] + [[0] * kind for _ in range(k-1)]
    
    for i in range(1, k):
        for j in range(1, kind):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][kind-j] * (cnt[j] - cnt[j-1])) % MOD
    
    print(dp[-1][kind-1])
    return

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

With these corrections, the code should be able to correctly calculate the number of sequences given the constraints.
