**Repaired Code**:
A few bugs and logic flaws have been identified and fixed in the original code. The repaired code is as follows:

```python
N, X, M = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
al = [X]
for i in range(N):
    ans += X
    X = (X**2) % M
    if X in al:
        start = al.index(X)
        loop = i - start + 1
        ans += sum(al[start:i + 1]) * ((N - i - 1) // loop)
        for j in range((N - i - 1) % loop):
            ans += al[start + j]
        break
    al.append(X)
print(ans)
```

This code first reads the input values for N, X, and M. Then it initializes a list `al` with the initial value `X`. It iterates `N` times, adding `X` to the `ans` variable and updating `X` according to the given recurrence relation. 

If `X` is found in the list `al`, it means that a loop has been found and the code calculates the sum of the values in the loop `(N - i - 1) // loop` times. It also calculates the remaining values in the loop separately for the case where `N - i - 1` is not divisible by `loop`.

Finally, the code prints the value of `ans`, which represents the sum of the values `A_i` for `1 <= i <= N`.
