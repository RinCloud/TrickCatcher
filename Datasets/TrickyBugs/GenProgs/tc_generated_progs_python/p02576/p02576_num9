```python
N, X, T = map(int, input().split())

print((N // X + (N % X != 0)) * T)
```

Explanation:
1. Instead of using `int(N / X + 0.9)`, we will use `(N // X + (N % X != 0))` to calculate the minimum number of batches required to make N pieces of takoyaki.
2. `(N % X != 0)` is used to check if there are any remaining pieces that can't fill a complete batch. If the condition is true, we add 1 to the number of batches.
3. The result is then multiplied by T to get the minimum number of minutes needed to make N pieces of takoyaki.
