```python
N, A, B = map(int, input().split())
if A > B or (B - A) > N:
    print(0)
else:
    if N == 1:
        if A == B:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(0)
    else:
        print(B - A + (N - 2) * (B - A + 1))
```
Explanation:
I added an additional condition to handle the case where N is equal to 1. In this case, the only possible sum is A or B, depending on if they are equal or not.
