Here is the repaired code:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# if k divides n, then the minimum difference is 0
if n % k == 0:
    print(0)
else:
    # if k does not divide n, then add 1 to the minimum difference
    print(1)
```

Explanation:
- We first split the input values and parse them as integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
- If `n` is evenly divisible by `k` (i.e., `n % k == 0`), then the minimum difference between the largest and smallest number of crackers received by a user is 0. So we print 0.
- Otherwise, if `n` is not evenly divisible by `k`, we add 1 to the minimum difference and print it as the output.
