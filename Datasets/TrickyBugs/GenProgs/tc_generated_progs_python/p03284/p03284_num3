**Repaired Code**:

The code provided is incorrect because it calculates the minimum possible (absolute) difference between the largest number of crackers received by a user and the smallest number received by a user incorrectly. 

To fix the code, we need to first distribute the crackers evenly among the users. Then, we can calculate the difference between the maximum number of crackers received by a user and the minimum number of crackers received by a user. Since the crackers are distributed evenly, the difference will always be less than or equal to 1.

Here's the repaired code:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Distribute crackers evenly among the users
min_crackers = n // k
remaining_crackers = n % k

# Add remaining crackers to some of the users
max_crackers = min_crackers + min(remaining_crackers, 1)

# Calculate the minimum possible difference between the largest and smallest number of crackers received
min_difference = max_crackers - min_crackers

print(min_difference)
```

This code correctly distributes the crackers evenly among the users and calculates the minimum possible difference between the largest and smallest number of crackers received.
