**FIXED CODE**:

The given code is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the minimum possible difference between the largest and smallest numbers of crackers received by a user.

Here is the corrected code:

```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
minimum_difference = n % k
print(minimum_difference)
```

The corrected code correctly calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by `k` and assigns it to the variable `minimum_difference`. Finally, it prints the minimum difference.
