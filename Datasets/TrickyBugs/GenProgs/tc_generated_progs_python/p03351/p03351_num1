Here are the repaired code.

```python
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
distAB = abs(a - b)
distBC = abs(b - c)
distAC = abs(a - c)

if distAB <= d and distBC <= d:
    print('Yes')
elif distAC <= d:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

The original code has a logical error in the condition for indirect communication. The condition should check if both the distances `distAB` and `distBC` are less than or equal to `d`, rather than sum the two distances. Additionally, the condition `abs(a-c) <= 16` is incorrect and should be `distAC <= d`.
