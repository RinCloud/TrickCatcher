As given, A and C can indirectly communicate when A and B can directly communicate and also B and C can directly communicate. 
The issue with the existing code is that it is checking the distance between A and C using a fixed value 16 instead of d.

I am providing you the repaired code below.

```python
a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
print('Yes' if (abs(a-b)<=d and abs(b-c)<=d) or abs(a-c)<=d else 'No')
```
