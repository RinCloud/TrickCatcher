FIXED CODE:
This code has a logic flaw. It checks the distance between A and C directly, if it is less than or equal to 16. 
But the correct logic should be:
* If A and B can directly communicate and B and C can directly communicate, then A and C can indirectly communicate.
* If that is not the case, we should check if A and C can directly communicate.
* The code is also assuming that d = 16, but that is not mentioned in the problem statement.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
if (abs(a - b) <= d and abs(b - c) <= d) or abs(a - c) <= d:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```
