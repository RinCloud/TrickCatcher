The code has a logic flaw. The loop iterates from 1 to b-1. However, it is possible for the condition `(a*i)%b == c` to be true for a value of i greater than or equal to b. Hence, the loop should iterate from 1 to b+1 to cover all possible cases.
The correct code is:

```python
a,b,c = map(int,input().split())

ans = "NO"
for i in range(1,b+1):
    if (a*i)%b == c:
        ans = "YES"

print(ans)
```
