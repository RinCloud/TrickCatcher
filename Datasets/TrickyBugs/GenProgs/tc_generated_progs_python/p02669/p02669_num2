The provided code has two bugs:
1. The formula used to calculate the value of m is incorrect. It should be `m = (n + (mag-1)) // mag`.
2. The variable `visited` is not updated correctly. It should be updated for each possible number m, not just for the initial number N.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush
from collections import defaultdict
Inf = 10**28
inpl = lambda: list(map(int,input().split()))
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N, A, B, C, D = inpl()
    visited = defaultdict(lambda: Inf)
    ans = Inf
    pool = [(0,N)] # coin, number
    while pool:
        c, n = heappop(pool)
        if c >= ans:
            break
        elif c > visited[n]:
            continue
        q = c + D*n
        if q < ans:
            ans = q

        for mag, cost in [(2,A), (3,B), (5,C)]:
            m = (n + (mag-1)) // mag
            q = c + abs(n - mag*m)*D + cost
            if q < ans and q < visited[m]:
                visited[m] = q
                heappush(pool, (q, m))

            visited[n] = min(visited[n], c)
    print(ans)
```
Note: I have added a line `visited[n] = min(visited[n], c)` to update the `visited` dictionary for the current number `n`.
