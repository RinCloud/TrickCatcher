The code has a few bugs and logical flaws. I will provide the corrected code below:

```python
# Get input
S_A = input()
S_B = input()
S_C = input()

# Initialize variables
turn = 0  # 0 represents Alice's turn, 1 represents Bob's turn, 2 represents Charlie's turn
decks = [S_A, S_B, S_C]  # List to store the decks of the players

# Iterate until a deck is empty
while True:
    # Check if current player's deck is empty
    if len(decks[turn]) == 0:
        player_names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
        print(player_names[turn][0])
        break

    # Get the top card from current player's deck
    card = decks[turn][0]

    # Update turn based on the letter on the card
    if card == 'a':
        turn = 0
    elif card == 'b':
        turn = 1
    elif card == 'c':
        turn = 2

    # Remove the top card from current player's deck
    decks[turn] = decks[turn][1:]
```

The corrected code fixes the following issues:

1. The original code did not initialize the decks of the players properly. It defined them as lists of individual characters instead of strings. This caused issues when trying to access the first element of the deck.
2. The original code used a nested list "Q" to store the decks, but this is unnecessary. I simplified it by using a single list "decks" to store the decks of all the players.
3. The original code did not update the turn correctly based on the letter on the card. It used the index of the letter 'k' in the list "i", but 'k' was not guaranteed to be in "i".
4. The original code used the "exit()" function to end the program, but this is not necessary. We can break out of the "while" loop instead.

I have also added comments to explain each step in the code.
