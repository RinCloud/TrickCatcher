# Plan

To solve this problem, we need to find the characters that appear in all of the input strings and construct the lexicographically smallest string using these characters.

To do this, we can iterate over all the lowercase English letters (`a` - `z`), count the number of occurrences of each letter in each string, and keep track of the minimum count for each letter.

Then, we can construct the lexicographically smallest string by appending the current letter to the result string the minimum count number of times.

Finally, we can print the result string.

# Revised code

```python
n = int(input())
s = []
for _ in range(n):
    s.append(input())

l = ''
for i in range(26):
    t = float('inf')
    for j in range(n):
        t = min(t, s[j].count(chr(97 + i)))
    l += chr(97 + i) * t

print(l)
```

The main changes in the code are:
- Removed the unnecessary conversion of input strings to lists of characters.
- Fixed the initialization of `t` from `n + 2` to `float('inf')` to ensure it is initialized to a larger value than any count.
- Concatenated the current letter `chr(97 + i)` to the result string `l` t times, instead of using a loop to append the letter t times.

This revised code should correctly solve the problem.
