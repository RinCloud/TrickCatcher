**REPAIRED CODE**:

```python
n, p = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
A_mod = [a % 2 for a in A]
if sum(A_mod) == 0:
    print(pow(2, n) if p == 0 else 0)
elif n >= 2:
    print(pow(2, n - 1))
else:
    print(1 if A_mod[0] == p else 0)
```

The original code contains some minor errors:

1. The variable `A` should be converted to `A_mod` as a list of the modulo 2 values of the elements in `A`. This is done using the expression `a % 2` for each element `a` in `A`.

2. In the case where `sum(A_mod) == 0`, the original code solves the problem correctly. However, it is preferable to use `pow(2, n)` instead of `pow(2, n) // 2` to count all possible subsets of the bags. This is because `pow(2, n)` represents the total number of subsets of `n` elements, while `pow(2, n) // 2` represents half of the total number of subsets. So the fixed code uses `pow(2, n)` when `p == 0` and `0` otherwise.

3. In the case where `n >= 2`, the original code uses `pow(2, n) // 2` to count all possible subsets of the bags. However, this should be changed to `pow(2, n - 1)`. This is because we need to exclude the case where no bags are selected, hence reducing the count by half. So the fixed code uses `pow(2, n - 1)` instead.

4. In the case where `n == 1`, the original code checks if `A[0] == p`. However, this should be changed to `A_mod[0] == p` to compare the modulo 2 value with `p` instead of the original value. So the fixed code uses `A_mod[0] == p` instead.
