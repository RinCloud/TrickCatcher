            new_s += '22'
        elif digit == '3':
            new_s += '333'
        elif digit == '4':
            new_s += '4444'
        elif digit == '5':

        elif digit == '6':
            new_s += '666666'
        elif digit == '7':
            new_s += '7777777'
        elif digit == '8':
            new_s += '88888888'
        elif digit == '9':
            new_s += '999999999'
        else:
            new_s += digit
    return new_s

s = input()
k = int(input())

s_new = s

    s_new = replace_digits(s_new)

print(s_new[k-1])
```

**Explanation:**
There are several issues in the given code. Here are the main issues and their fixes:

1. The given code uses `map(int, input())` to read the string `S`. However, this will actually convert each character to its ASCII integer value instead of treating the string as a sequence of digits. So we need to replace `map(int, input())` with just `input()` to read the string correctly.

2. The given code checks if the current index + 1 is equal to `K`, or if the current value `v` is greater than `1`, in order to determine the K-th character from the left. However, this logic is incorrect. According to the problem statement, we need to apply the digit replacement rules to the string `S` repeatedly for 5 * 10^15 days. So the final string `S` after applying the rules for the given number of days should be used to find the K-th character. Additionally, we want the K-th character from the left, so we need to access `s[k-1]` instead of `v` in the loop.

3. To apply the digit replacement rules repeatedly, we can define a separate function `replace_digits` that replaces each digit according to the rules. This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with the replaced digits. The given code does not have this function, so we need to define it.

By implementing these fixes, we can obtain the correct output for the given problem.
