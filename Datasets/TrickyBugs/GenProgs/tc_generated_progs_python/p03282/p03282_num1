The given code has a logic flaw. It only prints the character at the Kth position of the string after 5 * 10^15 days if the character is larger than `1` or if its index is equal to K. However, according to the problem description, the string changes every day, not just when the character is larger than `1` or its index is equal to K. Therefore, we need to modify the logic to handle each day of string transformation correctly.

Additionally, the current code uses the `map` function on the input string `s`, which would return a `map` object in Python 3. We should convert it to a list to get the actual list of integers.

Here's the repaired code:

```python
s = list(map(int, input()))
k = int(input())

index = 0
while k > 0:
    if index == len(s):
        break
    if s[index] == 1:
        index += 1
        continue

    count = s[index]
    if k <= count:
        print(s[index])
        break
    else:
        k -= count
        index += 1

if k > 0:
    print(1)
```

This code uses a while loop to iterate through the string `s`. For each digit, it checks if the remaining k is less than or equal to the count (number of times the digit is repeated). If so, it prints the digit and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it subtracts the count from k and moves to the next digit.

If the loop completes without breaking, it means that k is larger than the length of the transformed string. In this case, we print `1`.
