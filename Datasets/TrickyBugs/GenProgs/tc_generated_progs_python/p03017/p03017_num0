The code is almost correct, but there is a small bug in the condition when c<d. The code checks if '##' is in s[a-1:d], however, this condition will not give correct result if there is a `#` between a and b. In that case, it would be possible for Snuke to jump over rocks to reach square C. The correct condition should be that there is no `#` between a and c. 

Here is the complete and corrected code:

```python
n, a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

if c < d:
    if '#' in s[a-1:c] or '#' in s[b-1:d]:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
else:
    if '#' in s[a-1:c] or '#' in s[b-1:d]:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
```
