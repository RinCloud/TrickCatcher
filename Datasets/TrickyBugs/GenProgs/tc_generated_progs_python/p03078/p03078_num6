**Repaired code**: 

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

x, y, z, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = sorted(int(i) for i in input().split())

a.sort(reverse=True)
b.sort(reverse=True)
c.sort(reverse=True)  # The 'c' list was not sorted previously

ab = sorted(i+j for i in a for j in b)[:-k-1:-1]
c = c[:k]
abc = sorted(i+j for i in ab for j in c)[:-k-1:-1]

print(*abc[:k], sep="\n")
```

Explanation:
- The problem in the given code was that the list `c` was not sorted. In the given problem, the list needs to be sorted in descending order to get the correct results. 
- The added line `c.sort(reverse=True)` ensures that `c` is sorted in descending order.
