I see that there is a bug in the code. The bug is that we are not considering the possibility of rewriting a number in the list to make Alice not reach the destination.

To fix this bug, I will modify the code to check for each plan whether it is feasible by considering the possibility of rewriting a number in the list.

Here is the repaired code:

```
N,start = map(int,input().split())
D = list(map(int,input().split()))
input()
Q = list(map(int,input().split()))

Q = [(k-1,i) for i,k in enumerate(Q)]
Q.sort()

P = [start]
for d in D:
  a = P[-1]
  b = abs(a-d)
  P.append(min(a,b))

result = [None]*len(Q)

x = 1

for i,d in zip(reversed(range(len(D))), reversed(D)):
  if Q[-1][0] == i:
    result[Q[-1][1]] = P[i] >= x
    Q.pop()
    if not Q:
      break

  if abs(x-d) <= x: # Fixed: Changed < to <=
    x += d

for r in result:
  print('YES' if r else 'NO')
```

Now the code should correctly determine whether each plan is feasible.
