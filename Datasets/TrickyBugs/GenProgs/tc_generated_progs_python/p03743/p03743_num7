**Repaired Code:**

**Explanation:**
The initial code has a logic flaw in the section where it tries to filter out the current list of numbers `D` based on the indices given in the query array `Q` which can be used as an attack vector to attack the vehicle at specific points to disable it from reaching the destination.
After analyzing the code, we can see that Alice inputs the array `D` in `P` and initializes `P` with the start point. Then it calculates the minimum distance at each point from the current position to the destination and stores it in the array `P`.

```python
P = [start]
for d in D:
  a = P[-1]
  b = abs(a-d)
  P.append(min(a,b))
```

After this, we have a `for` loop which iterates over the reversed elements of `D`. In this loop, the code checks if the current position is the target position. If yes, then it checks whether distance through the previous positions till this target point satisfies the condition or not and adds "YES" or "NO" as required.

```python
for i,d in zip(reversed(range(len(D))), reversed(D)):
  if Q[-1][0] == i:
    result[Q[-1][1]] = P[i] >= x
    Q.pop()
    if not Q:
      break

  if abs(x-d) < x:
    x += d
```
From the above loop, it can be identified that the issue lies when the code compares the target `Q[-1][0]` with the current position `i`. If they match, it checks whether the distance `P[i]` traveled so far satisfies the condition `P[i] >= x`, otherwise it moves to the next position. 
But the flaw in this approach is if somewhere between its place and the target point is very far because they have increased greatly, then the code is susceptible to going far away from the target point. Instead of checking each position separately, it should have kept track of whether by moving from position `i` to the required target point it is satisfying the condition mentioned above. If it is not, then any further position cannot satisfy the condition. It should have considered the position where the attacks can succeed, dealing with them correctly, and then traversing to the required target.

Hence, the code needs an altered approach.

**Steps to be done as a bug fix:**

1. Initialize `x = start`
2. Create an empty array `attack` with the maximum possible size, where the maximum possible size given by the constraints `5*10^5`.
3. Find out which attacks can reach the target position. Count the distance of continuous positions which can reach the target site from the current position.
4. Iterate through the positions backward and put the gap of positions that can reach the target position in array `attack`.
5. Apply sum for all the locations to check if at a given specific position they satisfy the required condition, if they do then write `YES` otherwise write `NO`.
6. Print the final answer after the complete iteration of the loop.

```python
N,start = map(int,input().split())
D = list(map(int,input().split()))
input()
Q = list(map(int,input().split()))

attack = [0] * (N + 1)
Cnt = 0
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
  if Cnt < D[i]:
    Cnt = D[i]
  else:
    attack[i] = 1
for i in range(N - 1):
  attack[i + 1] += attack[i]
for i in Q:
  if attack[i - 1] <= start or attack[i] < start:
    print("YES")
  else:
    print("NO")
```
Since the code is implemented correctly we do not need to change anything in the standard Input and Output command section of the code.

Hence this will be our final fixed code.
