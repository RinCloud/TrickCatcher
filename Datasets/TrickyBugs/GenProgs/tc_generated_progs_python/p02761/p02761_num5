Your code is mostly correct, but there are a couple of issues that need to be fixed.

1. The condition to check if the integer has exactly N digits is incorrect. Instead of checking `if n==1`, you should check if `m == 0` (since `m` represents the number of conditions).

2. When there are no conditions (`m == 0`), you need to print the smallest integer with N digits. Currently, you're printing 0, which is incorrect. You need to print `10**(n-1)`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
f = sorted([list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(m)])

if m == 0:
    print(10 ** (n - 1))
else:
    for i in range(10 ** (n - 1), 10 ** n):
        d = str(i)
        for b, v in f:
            if int(d[b - 1]) != v:
                break
        else:
            print(i)
            exit()

    print(-1)
```

This code now correctly handles the cases where there are no conditions, and it properly prints the smallest integer with exactly N digits.
