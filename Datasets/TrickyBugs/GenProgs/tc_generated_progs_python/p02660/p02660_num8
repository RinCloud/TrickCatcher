**BUG FIX**:
There is a bug in the above code. It does not handle the case when the remaining number `n` after all the divided operations is greater than 1. In such cases, the code incorrectly increment the `answer` variable by 1. 

To fix this bug, we need to add an additional condition to check if `n` is greater than 1 after the inner while loop ends. If it is, we increment `answer` by 1.

Here is the complete code with the bug fix:

```python
import math

n = int(input())
m = n

answer = 0
i = 2
while i ** 2 <= m:
    t = 0
    while n % i == 0:
        n //= i
        t += 1
    answer += int((-1+math.sqrt(1+8*t)) / 2)
    i += 1

if n > 1:
    answer += 1

print(answer)
```
With this fix, the code should now handle the case correctly and return the maximum number of times the operation can be applied.
