**REPAIRED CODE**:

```python
import math

n = int(input())
m = n

answer = 0
i = 2
while i ** 2 <= m:
    t = 0
    while n % i == 0:
        n //= i
        t += 1
    answer += int((-1+math.sqrt(1+8*t)) / 2)
    i += 1

if n > 1:
    answer += 1

print(answer)
```

The only issue with the given code is in the last if condition. The condition should be `if n > 1` instead of `if n > 1000000` because any number greater than 1 is a valid prime number, not just numbers greater than 1000000.
