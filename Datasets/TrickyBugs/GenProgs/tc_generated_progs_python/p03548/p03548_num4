```
X,Y,Z=map(int,input().split())
print((X-2*Z)//(Y+Z)+((X-2*Z)%(Y+Z))//Y)
```

The code has a logic flaw that results in incorrect output.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
X, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())
gap = Y + Z
seat = X - Z
people = seat // gap
print(people)
```

Explanation:
- We first calculate the gap size between two people, which is Y + Z.
- Then we calculate the total available seat size, which is X - Z.
- Finally, we divide the seat size by the gap size to get the maximum number of people that can be seated.
