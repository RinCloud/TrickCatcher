**Repaired code**:

```python
N=int(input())
s=input()
t=input()

a=0
b=0

for i in range(N):
    if s[i]==t[a]:
        a+=1
        b+=1
    else:
        b=0

print(len(s)+len(t) - b)
```
There was a bug where we were not resetting `b` to 0 whenever there is a mismatch between characters at `s[i]` and `t[a]`. Thus, I added an `else` clause to reset `b` to 0.

Additionally, the length of the shortest string is the sum of lengths of `s` and `t`, subtract the mismatch `b`. Hence, I modified the `print` statement accordingly.
