The given code has several bugs and logic flaws. Here are the mistakes in the code:

1. The `getinputdata()` function is not properly written. It is using an infinite loop with a `flg` variable which is set to `True` initially but never changed to `False` inside the loop. This will result in an infinite loop, and the program will never terminate. We can simplify the function for this particular problem by using the `split()` method directly on the input string.

2. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `arr_data[0][0]`. But this value is stored as a string, and we need to convert it to an integer before using it in calculations.

3. The variable `m` is converted to an integer using `int(arr_data[0][1])`, but it is not used anywhere in the code. We can remove it.

4. The logic to check for possible boat services is incorrect. The code is only checking if there is a single common island between `arr01` and `arr02`. But we need to check if there is a possible pair of boat services that can take us from Island 1 to Island N. This requires checking for two common islands - one from `arr01` and one from `arr02`.

Here is the corrected code:

```
# Read input
n, m = map(int, input().split())

arr01 = []
arr02 = []

# Store the islands connected to Island 1 and N
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        arr01.append(b)
    if b == n:
        arr02.append(a)

# Check if there is a possible pair of boat services
possible = False
for island in arr01:
    if island in arr02:
        possible = True
        break

# Print the result
print("POSSIBLE" if possible else "IMPOSSIBLE")
```

This code reads the input using `input()` and `split()`, and then checks for a possible pair of boat services using a loop. The correct result is then printed based on the `possible` variable.
