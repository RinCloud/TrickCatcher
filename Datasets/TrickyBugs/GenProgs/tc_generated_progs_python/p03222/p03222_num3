The given code contains some bugs, which are as follows:

1. Line 15 is calculating the `dic` values incorrectly. The correct `dic` values should be the first W Fibonacci numbers. Replace line 15 with the following code:
```python
dic = [1, 2]
for i in range(2, W):
    dic.append(dic[i - 1] + dic[i - 2])
```

2. The loop on line 20 should iterate from 1 to W instead of 1 to W-1. Replace line 20 with the following code:
```python
for j in range(1, W):
```

3. The modulo operation on line 25 should be performed after each calculation to avoid integer overflow. Replace line 25 with the following code:
```python
a[i][0] = (a[i - 1][0] * dic[W - 2] + a[i - 1][1] * dic[W - 3]) % 1000000007
```

4. The inner loop on line 28 should iterate from 1 to W instead of 1 to W-1. Replace line 28 with the following code:
```python
for j in range(1, W):
```

5. The calculations on lines 29, 30, and 31 are missing the modulo operation. Add the modulo operation `% 1000000007` at the end of each calculation:
```python
a[i][j] = (a[i - 1][j - 1] * dic[j - 2] * dic[W - j - 2] + a[i - 1][j] * dic[j - 1] * dic[W - j - 2] + a[i - 1][j + 1] * dic[j - 1] * dic[W - j - 3]) % 1000000007
```

6. The calculation on line 32 is missing the modulo operation. Add the modulo operation `% 1000000007` at the end of the calculation:
```python
a[i][W - 1] = (a[i - 1][W - 1] * dic[W - 2] + a[i - 1][W - 2] * dic[W - 3]) % 1000000007
```

Here is the complete repaired code:

```python
import sys

H, W, K = map(int, input().split())
if W == 1:
    print(1)
    sys.exit()
elif W == 2:
    print(2**(H - 1))
    sys.exit()

dic = [1, 2]
for i in range(2, W):
    dic.append(dic[i - 1] + dic[i - 2])

a = [[0]*W for i in range(H + 1)]
a[0][0] = 1

for i in range(1, H + 1):
    a[i][0] = (a[i - 1][0] * dic[W - 2] + a[i - 1][1] * dic[W - 3]) % 1000000007
    for j in range(1, W):
        a[i][j] = (a[i - 1][j - 1] * dic[j - 2] * dic[W - j - 2] + a[i - 1][j] * dic[j - 1] * dic[W - j - 2] + a[i - 1][j + 1] * dic[j - 1] * dic[W - j - 3]) % 1000000007
    a[i][W - 1] = (a[i - 1][W - 1] * dic[W - 2] + a[i - 1][W - 2] * dic[W - 3]) % 1000000007

print(a[H][K - 1])
```
