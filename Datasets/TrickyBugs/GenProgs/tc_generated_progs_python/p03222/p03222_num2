**Repaired code**:

```python
import sys

H, W, K = map(int, input().split())
if W == 1:
    print(1)
    sys.exit()
elif W == 2:
    print(2 ** (H - 1))
    sys.exit()

dic = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 0]

a = [[0] * W for _ in range(H + 1)]
a[0][0] = 1

for i in range(1, H + 1):
    a[i][0] = a[i - 1][0] * dic[W - 2] + a[i - 1][1] * dic[W - 3]
    for j in range(1, W - 1):
        a[i][j] = a[i - 1][j - 1] * dic[j - 2] * dic[W - j - 2] + a[i - 1][j] * dic[j - 1] * dic[W - j - 2] + a[i - 1][j + 1] * dic[j - 1] * dic[W - j - 3]
    a[i][W - 1] = a[i - 1][W - 1] * dic[W - 2] + a[i - 1][W - 2] * dic[W - 3]

print(a[H][K - 1] % 1000000007)
```

Explanation:
- Line 13: Corrected typo by replacing '1' with '0' in the last element of the `dic` array.
- Line 18: Replaced `range(H)` with `range(H + 1)` to ensure that the `a` array has the correct dimensions.
- Line 9: Added an underscore `_` as a variable name to indicate that it is a throwaway variable, which is commonly used when looping over a range without using the loop variable.
- Line 23: Moved the closing parenthesis of the `dic[W - j - 2]` term from the end of line 24 to the end of line 23. This ensures that the multiplication is performed before the addition.
- Fixed indentation and added new lines for better readability.
