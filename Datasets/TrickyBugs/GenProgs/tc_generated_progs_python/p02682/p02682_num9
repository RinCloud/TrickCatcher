To solve the problem, we want to maximize the sum of the numbers written on the cards chosen. 

The given code has a bug. In the case where `a < k`, the calculation in the `else` block is incorrect. The correct logic is to subtract both `b` and `c` from `k - a` to get the remaining number of cards to pick, and then add `a` to this remaining number if it is less than or equal to `b`. Otherwise, we can just subtract `b` from the remaining number of cards to pick. 

Here is the fixed code:

```python
a, b, c, k = map(int, input().split())
if a >= k:
    print(k)
else:
    remaining = k - a
    if remaining <= b:
        print(a + remaining)  # Add remaining to a
    else:
        remaining -= b
        print(a - remaining)  # Subtract remaining from a
```

The repaired code correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the numbers written on the cards chosen.
