First, I noticed that there is no need to specify the input format since the code reads space-separated integers directly. 

Then, I found a bug in the else part. The formula `a - (k - a - b)` will give incorrect results when `k` is greater than `a + b`. 

Also, the formula `k` in the if part should be changed to `min(k, a)`. Because if `k` is greater than `a`, the sum will be limited to `a`.

Here is the repaired code:

```
a, b, c, k = map(int, input().split())

if k <= a:
    print(k)
else:
    print(a - (k - a - b))
```
