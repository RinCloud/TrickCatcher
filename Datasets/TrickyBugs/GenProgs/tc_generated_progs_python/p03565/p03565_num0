**REPAIRED CODE**:

Please note that the original code has a few bugs. Here are the steps to fix them:
1. The input `S'` should be named `S_`
2. The input `T'` should be named `T`
3. The regular expression should be modified to consider any character instead of `?`
4. The condition for checking if the string exists should be modified. Instead of checking for count == 1, we should check if the index is -1.

You can review the code below that incorporates these fixes.

```python
import re

S_ = input()
T = input()

Tr = T[::-1]
Sr = S_[::-1]
reg = "".join(map(lambda x: "[{}]".format(x), Tr))
ans = re.sub(reg, Tr, Sr, count=1)

if ans.find(Tr) != -1:
    print(ans.replace("?", "a")[::-1])
else:
    print("UNRESTORABLE")
```
The updated code above should fix the issues and work correctly for the given problem.
