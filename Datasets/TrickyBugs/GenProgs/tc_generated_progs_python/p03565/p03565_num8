**FIXED CODE**:

```python
import re

def restore_string(S_, T):
    Tr = T[::-1]
    Sr = S_[::-1]
    reg = "".join(map(lambda x: "[{}{}]".format(x, '?'), Tr))
    ans = re.sub(reg, Tr, Sr, count=1)
    if ans.count(Tr)==1:
        return ans.replace("?", "a")[::-1]
    else:
        return "UNRESTORABLE"

S_ = input()
T = input()
print(restore_string(S_, T))
```

Explaination:

- I defined a function called `restore_string` that takes `S_` and `T` as parameters and returns the string `S`.
- I updated the regular expression to also include the `'?'` character, since it was missing in the original code.
- Instead of printing the result directly, I returned it from the `restore_string` function and printed it outside the function call.
- I also replaced the last print statement with `return "UNRESTORABLE"` since it is a function now.
- Lastly, I moved the input reading code outside the function so that the function call `restore_string(S_, T)` only contains the logic to solve the problem.
