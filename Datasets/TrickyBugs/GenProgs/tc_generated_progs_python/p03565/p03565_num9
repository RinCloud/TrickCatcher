The given code has a bug. It counts the number of occurences of string 'T' in the generated 'ans' using `ans.count(Tr)`, which gives the count of all occurences. But as per the problem statement, we need to check if it is a contiguous substring or not.

Here is the repaired code:

```python
import re
S_ = input()
T = input()
Tr = T[::-1]
Sr = S_[::-1]
reg = "".join(map(lambda x: "[{}?]".format(x), Tr))
ans = re.sub(reg, Tr, Sr, count=1)
if Tr not in ans:
    print("UNRESTORABLE")
else:
    res = ans.replace("?", "a")[::-1]
    start = ans.index(Tr) + len(Tr)
    end = start + S_.index('?')
    res = res[:end] + S_[end:].replace('?', 'a')[::-1]
    print(res)
```

This code iterates through the generated reversed string `ans` and checks if `Tr` exists as a substring. If it does not exist, it prints "UNRESTORABLE". Otherwise, it replaces all the '?' characters in `ans` with 'a' and then replaces the remaining '?' characters in the original string `S_` with 'a'. It then prints the updated string `res`.

This code should correctly solve the problem.
