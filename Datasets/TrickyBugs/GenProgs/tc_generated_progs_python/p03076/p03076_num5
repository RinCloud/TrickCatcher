The given code has a logical error in line 12. The intention of the if statement is to check if the remainder of A divided by 10 is greater than the remainder of B divided by 10 and if the remainder of B divided by 10 is greater than 0. However, the condition is incorrect. It should be modified as follows:
```python
if A % 10 > B % 10 > 0: A, B = B, A
```
Additionally, there is a missing input statement for variable E.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
A = int(input())
ans = 0

for i in range(4):
    B = int(input())
    if A % 10 > B % 10 > 0:
        A, B = B, A
    ans += -(-B//10)*10

E = int(input())

print(A+ans)
```
