There are two issues with the code:
1. The last dish is not being inputted. The loop is running for only 4 iterations instead of 5.
2. The condition in the if statement is incorrect. It should check if A%10 > B%10 instead of A%10 > B%10 > 0.

Here is the corrected code:

```
A = int(input())
ans = 0

for i in range(5):
    B = int(input())
    if A % 10 > B % 10:
        A, B = B, A
    ans += -(-B // 10) * 10

print(A + ans)
```
