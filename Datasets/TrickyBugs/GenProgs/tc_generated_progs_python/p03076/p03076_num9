The given code has a logic flaw. The code checks if the lowest digit of `B` is greater than zero, `B%10>0`, but it should actually check if the lowest digit of `B` is not zero, `B%10!=0`, to adhere to the restaurant's rule of only allowing orders at a multiple of 10 time.

Here is the complete repaired code:

```
A=int(input())
ans=0

for i in range(4):
    B=int(input())
    if A%10>B%10!=0: A,B=B,A
    ans+=-(-B//10)*10

print(A+ans)
```
