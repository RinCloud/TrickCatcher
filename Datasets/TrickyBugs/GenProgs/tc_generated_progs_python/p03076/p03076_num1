Here is the corrected code:

```python
A=int(input())
ans=0

for i in range(4):
    B=int(input())
    if A%10>B%10>0: 
        A,B=B,A
    ans+=-(-B//10)*10

print(A+ans)
```

The issue in the original code was that the if condition was not properly indented, causing the swapping of the values A and B to happen unconditionally. The condition should be indented so that the swapping only occurs when both of the conditions (`A%10>B%10` and `B%10>0`) are satisfied.
