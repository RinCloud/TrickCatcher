***Repaired Code***:

```python
a = int(input())

if a < 1200:
    print("ABC")
else:
    print("ARC")
```
In the original code, the input was not converted to an integer (`int`) before comparing it with `1200`. As a result, the string comparison `<` was used for comparing a string to an integer, which would result in incorrect comparison. Therefore, the input needs to be converted to an integer using `int()` before performing the comparison.
