**BUG FIX**
The given code works fine, however, it is quite hard to read and understand. I would rewrite the code for better readability and understanding.

The problem requires us to check if a given 4-digit integer N is good or not.

A 4-digit integer is considered good if it has three or more consecutive same digits.

I will provide you with a modified version of the code that is more readable and understandable.

Here's the modified code to solve the problem:

```python
N = int(input())

digits = [int(digit) for digit in str(N)]

if digits[0] == digits[1] == digits[2] or digits[1] == digits[2] == digits[3]:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

Explanation:
- We convert the input integer N into a list of digits using the `str()` and `int()` functions.
- We then check if either the first three digits or the last three digits are equal. If any of these conditions are met, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".
