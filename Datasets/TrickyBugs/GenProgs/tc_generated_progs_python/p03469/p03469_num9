```python
s = input()
print("2018/01/" + s[8:])
```
In the given code, the correct year `2018` is appended to the string instead of replacing the incorrect year.
To fix this, we should replace the first four characters in `s` with `2018`, instead of appending it at the end of the string.
The corrected code is as follows:

```python
s = input()
print("2018" + s[4:])
```
