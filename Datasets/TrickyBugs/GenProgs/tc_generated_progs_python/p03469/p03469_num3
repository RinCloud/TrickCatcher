**Repaired Code**:

```python
s = input()
print("2018" + s[4:])
```

**Explanation**:

The given code will replace only the last two digits of the year in the string, instead of replacing the first four characters of the year.
To correctly solve the problem, we need to replace the first four characters of the string with '2018'.
The corrected code takes the substring from index 4 (inclusive) till the end of the string and concatenates it with the '2018' string. This way it replaces the first four characters ('2017') with '2018' and prints the modified string.
