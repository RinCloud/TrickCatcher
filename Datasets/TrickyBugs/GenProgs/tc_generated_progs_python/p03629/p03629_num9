**Repaired code**:

```
import string

if __name__ == '__main__':
    A = input()

    p = {}
    for x in string.ascii_lowercase:
        p[x] = len(A)

    tb = [(0, '', 0)] * (len(A) + 1)
    tb[-2] = (1, '', 0)
    tb[-1] = (0, '', 0)

    for i, x in reversed(list(enumerate(A))):
        p[x] = i
        tb[i] = min([(tb[p[c] + 1][0] + 1, c, p[c] + 1) for c in string.ascii_lowercase])

    i = 0
    ans = []
    while i < len(A):
        ans.append(tb[i][1])
        i = tb[i][2]

    print("".join(ans))
```

The original code had two issues:
1. The `tb` list was initialized incorrectly. The original code used the tuple `(0, 0, 0)` for each element of `tb`, but it should have been `(0, '', 0)` because the second element of the tuple is expected to be a string.
2. The indexing of `tb` was incorrect. The original code used `tb.append((1, 0, 0))` and `tb.append((0, 0, 0))` to add elements at the end, but it should have been `tb[-2] = (1, '', 0)` and `tb[-1] = (0, '', 0)` to add them at the second-to-last and last position, respectively.
