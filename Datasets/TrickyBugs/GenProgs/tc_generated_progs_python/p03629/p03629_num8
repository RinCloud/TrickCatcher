The code has a bug in the line `tb = [(0, 0, 0)] * len(A)`. This creates a list of tuples, where each tuple is a reference to the same tuple `(0,0,0)`. When we later update the values of these tuples in the loop, all the tuples in the `tb` list will be updated with the same values.

To fix this bug, we need to create a list of unique tuples. We can achieve this by using a list comprehension instead of the multiplication operator.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import string

if __name__ == '__main__':
    A = input()

    p = {}
    for x in string.ascii_lowercase:
        p[x] = len(A)

    tb = [(0, 0, 0) for _ in range(len(A))]  # Use list comprehension

    for i, x in reversed(list(enumerate(A))):
        p[x] = i
        tb[i] = min([(tb[p[c] + 1][0] + 1, c, p[c] + 1) for c in string.ascii_lowercase])

    i = 0
    ans = []
    while i < len(A):
        ans.append(tb[i][1])
        i = tb[i][2]

    print("".join(ans))
```

Now, the code will correctly compute and print the lexicographically smallest string among the shortest strings that are not subsequences of string A.
