Repaired code:

```python
n = int(input())

if n % 10 == 0:
    print(1)
else:
    nums = list(map(int, str(n)))
    print(sum(nums))
```

Explanation:
- The original code prints 10 if n is divisible by 10, instead of 1 (which is the sum of the digits of the remainder after dividing by 10).
- The original code used `[x for x in str(n)]` to convert the digits of n into a list of integers, but it can be simplified to `list(map(int, str(n)))`.
