**Repaired code**:

```python
from collections import Counter

n = int(input())
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
mod = 10**9+7

if n % 2 == 0:
  counts = Counter(l)
  if len(set(l)) == n//2 and counts.most_common()[0][1] == 2:
    print(2**(n//2)%mod)
  else:
    print(0)
else:
  counts = Counter(l)
  if l.count(0) == 1 and counts.most_common()[0][1] == 2:
    print(2**((n-1)//2)%mod)
  else:
    print(0)
```

Explanation:

- I added `from collections import Counter` to use the Counter class to count the occurrence of numbers in the list `l`.
- In the original code, if `n` is odd and there is only one 0 in the list, then it checks if `n` is odd and the number of zeros is 1. However, this is incorrect. The number of zeros should not be more than 1. Therefore, I changed it to check if there is exactly one zero in the list.
- I applied a similar logic for the case when `n` is even. I checked if the most common number in the list appears exactly twice and all other numbers appear only once.
- If the conditions are satisfied, then the number of possible orders is calculated using the formula 2^(n//2) (for even `n`) or 2^((n-1)//2) (for odd `n`). Otherwise, the output is 0.
