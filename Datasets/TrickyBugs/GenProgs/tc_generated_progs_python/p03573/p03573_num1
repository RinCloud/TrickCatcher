The given code has a logical flaw. 

The current logic is checking if b == c, then returns a; if c == a, then returns b; if a == b, then returns c. However, this logic is incorrect.

Let's consider an example: a = 5, b = 7, c = 5. According to the given problem statement, two numbers should be the same, and the third number should be different. In this case, a and c are the same, and b is different. But the given code will return 5 instead of 7.

To fix this issue, we need to change the logic of the code.

Repaired code:
```python
a, b, c = map(int, input().split())

if a == b:
    print(c)
elif a == c:
    print(b)
else:
    print(a)
```

In the repaired code, we check for two conditions:
1. If a is equal to b, then the different number is c.
2. If a is equal to c, then the different number is b.
If neither of these conditions is true, then the different number is a.
