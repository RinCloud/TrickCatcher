**CORRECTED CODE:**

```python
import re

S = input()

if re.fullmatch('(dream|dreamer|erase|eraser)*', S):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```
The `re.match()` function only checks whether the regular expression matches at the beginning of the string. In this case, we need to check the entire string, so we use `re.fullmatch()` instead. Additionally, we need to use the `|` character instead of `|` to match any of the options in the regular expression.
