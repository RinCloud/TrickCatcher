The code seems to have some bugs and logic flaws that need to be fixed. Here are the issues:

1. The code does not handle the case where `K` is greater than the total number of white squares in the chocolate bar. In that case, the output should be 0, but the current code does not consider this situation.

2. The code uses a binary representation to generate all possible combinations of cuts. However, it only checks a subset of possible combinations. The range of the loop that iterates over the subsets should be `range(2**(H-1))`, but it is currently `range(H)`.

3. The variable `m` is initialized with a value that is one less than the maximum number of cuts, which may not be correct. The maximum number of cuts should be `H-1` because if we cut all the rows except for the last one, we have `H-1` cuts.

4. The variable `c` counts the number of cuts made, but it is not correctly updated. It should be incremented when a cut is made, but currently it is incremented in the next iteration of the loop. It should be moved inside the inner loop that iterates over the rows.

5. The variable `u` is initialized with -1, but it should be initialized with `d+1` because `d` is the last row index of the previous cut, and the next cut should start from the row after that.

6. The condition `if b==w-1` checks if the previous cut ended at the previous column, but it should actually check if the previous cut ended at the previous row. This condition can be removed because it is not required for correct computation.

Here is the repaired code:

```python
H, W, K = map(int, input().split())
S = [[int(x) for x in list(input().strip())] for _ in range(H)]
T = [[0] * (W+1) for _ in range(H+1)]

def main():
    for h in range(H):
        for w in range(W):
            T[h][w] = T[h][w-1] + S[h][w]

    for h in range(1, H):
        for w in range(W):
            T[h][w] = T[h][w] + T[h-1][w]

    min_cuts = H - 1
    for p in range(2 ** (H - 1)):
        D = [x for x in range(H - 1) if p & (2 ** x) != 0] + [H - 1]
        c = 0
        u = D[0] + 1
        for w in range(W):
            for d in D:
                if T[d][w] - T[u][w] - T[d][w-1] + T[u][w-1] > K:
                    c += 1
                    u = d+1
            if c > min_cuts:
                break
        else:
            min_cuts = min(min_cuts, c)
    if K == 0:
        min_cuts = 0
    print(min_cuts)
main()
```
