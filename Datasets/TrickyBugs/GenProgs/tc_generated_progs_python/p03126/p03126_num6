Repaired code:

```python
n,m=map(int,input().split())
foods=[]
for _ in range(n):
  *b,=map(int,input().split())
  b=b[1:]
  foods.append(set(b))

s = set(range(1, m+1))
for food in foods:
  s = s & food
print(len(s))
```

Explanations:

- I added a list called "foods" to store the sets of foods liked by each person.
- I also created a set called "s" to store the intersection of all sets of foods liked by each person.
- The line "s = set(range(1, m+1))" is used to initialize the set "s" with all possible foods (from 1 to m).
- In the loop, I iterate over each set of foods liked by each person and update the set "s" by taking the intersection with the current set. This is done with the line "s = s & food".
- Finally, I print the length of the set "s" to get the number of foods liked by all people.

This repaired code should correctly solve the problem.
