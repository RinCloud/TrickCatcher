Here is the repaired code:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())

s = set()
for _ in range(n):
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))[1:]
    a = set(b)
    if not s:
        s = a
    else:
        s = s & a

print(len(s))
```

Changes made:
- Fixed indentation errors.
- Changed the code setting `s` as a dictionary to initially set `s` as an empty set `s = set()`.
- Changed the code from using the wildcard operator `*` to directly assigning the result of `map(int, input().split())` to the list `b`. 
- Changed the code to extract the elements of `b` starting from index 1 to exclude the value of `K_i` from the set `a`.
- Simplified the update of `s` in the `else` clause to `s = s & a`.
