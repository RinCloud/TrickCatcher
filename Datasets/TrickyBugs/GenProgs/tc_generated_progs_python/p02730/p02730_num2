REPAIRED CODE:

```python
s = input()
n = len(s)
if s != s[::-1]:
    print('No')
else:
    if s[:n//2] != s[:n//2][::-1]:
        print('No')
    elif s[(n+3)//2-1:] != s[(n+3)//2-1:][::-1]:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
```

In the code provided, I have added two conditions to check for the second and third conditions of a strong palindrome. The first condition checks if the string `S` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If it is not a palindrome, then it is not a strong palindrome. 

The second condition checks if the string formed by the 1st through `((N-1)/2)-th` characters of `S` (where `N` is the length of `S`) is a palindrome. To do this, I compare the substring `s[:n//2]` with its reverse `s[:n//2][::-1]`. If they are not the same, then it is not a strong palindrome. 

The third condition checks if the string consisting of the `(N+3)/2-th` through `N-th` characters of `S` is a palindrome. To do this, I compare the substring `s[(n+3)//2-1:]` with its reverse `s[(n+3)//2-1:][::-1]`. If they are not the same, then it is not a strong palindrome.

If all three conditions are satisfied, then I print `Yes`.
