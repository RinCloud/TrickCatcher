To determine whether a string is a strong palindrome, we need to check three conditions:
1. The string is a palindrome.
2. The first half of the string, excluding the middle character if the length is odd, is a palindrome.
3. The second half of the string is a palindrome.

There is a bug in the given code. It is incorrectly counting the occurrences of the first half of the string to check if it is a palindrome.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the reverse of the first half of the string is equal to the first half of the string itself.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
s = input()
is_palindrome = s == s[::-1]
is_first_half_palindrome = s[:len(s)//2] == s[:len(s)//2][::-1]
is_second_half_palindrome = s[(len(s)+1)//2:] == s[(len(s)+1)//2:][::-1]

if is_palindrome and is_first_half_palindrome and is_second_half_palindrome:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

Now the code correctly checks all three conditions and determines whether the string is a strong palindrome.
