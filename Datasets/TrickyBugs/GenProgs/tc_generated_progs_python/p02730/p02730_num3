**CORRECTED CODE:**

```python
s = input()

if s == s[::-1]:
    first_half = s[:len(s)//2]
    if first_half == first_half[::-1]:
        second_half = s[(len(s)+3) // 2 - 1:]
        if second_half == second_half[::-1]:
            print("Yes")
            exit()
print("No")
```

Explanation:
1. First, check if the given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
2. If it is a palindrome, then check if the first half of the string is also a palindrome.
3. If the first half is a palindrome, then check if the second half of the string is also a palindrome.
4. If all the conditions are satisfied, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".
