I found a bug in the code.
The code currently checks all possible combinations of powers from 2 to 5 for each base starting from 0 to 31. However, this is incorrect as it does not cover all possible perfect powers.
To fix this, we need to iterate over all possible powers from 2 to the square root of X. For each power, we need to find the largest base that, when raised to the power, does not exceed X.
I will now provide the repaired code.

**REPAIRED CODE**:
```
x = int(input())
result = 1
for power in range(2, int(x**0.5)+1):
    base = 2
    while base**power <= x:
        result = base**power
        base += 1
print(result)
```
