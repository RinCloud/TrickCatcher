To solve this problem, we need to check if the concatenation of integers a and b is a square number. The given code is attempting to solve this problem but there is a bug in the code.

The bug is in the line `x=eval(input().replace(" ",""))`. This line concatenates the values of a and b without any separation. So, if a=1 and b=21, the concatenation will be 121 instead of 121.

To fix this bug, we need to add a space between the values of a and b while concatenating them. We can achieve this by modifying the line to `x=int(str(a)+ " " +str(b))`.

Here is the complete repaired code:

```
a, b = map(int, input().split())
x = int(str(a) + " " + str(b))
print("Yes" if x % int(x**0.5) == 0 else "No")
```
