I found several issues with the code:

1. The code is not reading the input correctly. It is using `open(0)` but it should be using `input()` function to read the input.

2. The code is using a complicated way to check for triplets of equal values. It converts the input values into a string and then checks for the substring '000'. This approach is confusing and error-prone.

3. The code is directly printing 'Yes' or 'No' based on a string indexing operation. This approach is not readable and makes the code hard to understand.

Here's the repaired code:

```
def check_triplets(N, rolls):
    for i in range(N - 2):
        if rolls[i][0] == rolls[i+1][0] == rolls[i+2][0] and rolls[i][1] == rolls[i+1][1] == rolls[i+2][1]:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

N = int(input())
rolls = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]

result = check_triplets(N, rolls)
print(result)
```

With this code, we define a function `check_triplets` that takes the number of rolls `N` and a list of rolls as arguments. It iterates over the rolls from the first to the (N-2)th roll, and checks if the current roll, the next roll, and the roll after that have equal values. If such triplets are found, it returns 'Yes', otherwise it returns 'No'.

We then read the input values using `input()` and store them in `N` and `rolls`. Finally, we call the `check_triplets` function with `N` and `rolls` as arguments and print the result.
