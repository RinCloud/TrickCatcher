**Repaired code:**

```
N = int(input())
doublets = False

for i in range(N-2):
    roll_1 = input()
    roll_2 = input()
    roll_3 = input()

    if roll_1[0] == roll_1[1] and roll_2[0] == roll_2[1] and roll_3[0] == roll_3[1]:
        doublets = True
        break

if doublets:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```
Explanation:

1. We initialize the `doublets` variable to be `False`, indicating that we have not found any triplets of doublets yet.
2. We iterate `N-2` times because we need to check triplets, so we need at least `N-2` rolls.
3. For each iteration, we read three lines representing three rolls:
    - `roll_1` represents the first roll (`D_{i,1} D_{i,2}`).
    - `roll_2` represents the second roll (`D_{i+1,1} D_{i+1,2}`).
    - `roll_3` represents the third roll (`D_{i+2,1} D_{i+2,2}`).
4. We check if all three rolls have doublets. If they do, we set `doublets` to `True` and break the loop.
5. After the loop ends, we check the value of `doublets`. If it is `True`, we print "Yes". Otherwise, we print "No".
