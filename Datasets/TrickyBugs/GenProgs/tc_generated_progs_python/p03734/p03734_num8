    for j in range(1, i+1):
        for k in range(v, 3*N+1):
            dp[j][k] = max(dp[j][k], dp[j-1][k-v] + w)
    
ans = 0
for i in range(1, N+1):
    wmax = W - w1 * i
    if wmax < 0:

print(ans)
```
Explanation:

1. The initial code starts with `dp[0][0] = 0` which means that 0 items with 0 weight have 0 value (base case). However, when selecting items, we need to consider the initial weight `w1` as well.
2. In the original code, the input for `w` and `v` in the inner loop starts from the second item (i.e. `for i in range(1, N):`) and the first item is handled separately. However, this approach is not correct as it does not consider the case where the first item is not selected. Therefore, we need to modify the inner loop to start from `1` and consider all items in each iteration.

Fixed code:
