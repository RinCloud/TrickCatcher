**REPAIRED CODE**:

```python
N, i = map(int, input().split())
j = N - i + 1
print(j)
```

The code is repaired by using `map()` function to convert the inputs to integers and splitting them by `split()` function instead of using `eval()`. The formula to find the value of j is `N - i + 1`, which is used to calculate `j`. Finally, the value of `j` is printed.
