**CORRECTED CODE**:

The code given in the problem statement is almost correct. However, we need to modify the code to compute j correctly. Currently, the code is computing `1+eval(input().replace(' ','-'))`. 

To find the desired value of j, we can compute it by subtracting i from N+1. The correct way to compute j is `(N+1) - i`.

Here is the corrected code:

```
N, i = map(int, input().split())
j = (N+1) - i
print(j)
```
