**Repaired code**:

```python
K, X = map(int, input().split())
if K * 500 >= X:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```
Explanation:
1. The original code uses regular expression to match the input, but this is not required for this problem.
2. The repaired code reads the input values for K and X using `input().split()` and assigns them to K and X respectively.
3. It then checks if K * 500 is greater than or equal to X. If it is, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
