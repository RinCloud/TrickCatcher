Here's the repaired code:

```python
K, X = map(int, input().split())
if K * 500 >= X:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

Explanation:
1. The original code uses regular expression matching to check if the input matches a particular pattern, which is unnecessary for this problem.
2. We can simply calculate the total yen by multiplying the number of coins (K) with the value of each coin (500). If the total yen is greater than or equal to X, we print 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.
