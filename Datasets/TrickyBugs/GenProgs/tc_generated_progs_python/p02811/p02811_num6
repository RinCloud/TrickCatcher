**REPAIRED CODE**:

```python
k, x = map(int, input().split())
if k * 500 >= x:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

The problem with the original code was that it used a regular expression to check if the number of coins is enough to add up to `X` yen. However, using regular expressions is unnecessary in this case, as we can simply multiply the number of coins (`k`) by 500 and check if it is greater than or equal to `X`. If it is, we print `Yes`, otherwise we print `No`.
